{"d":"2023-10-28T08:05:57Z","t":"It was a quiet night in the countryside. A young girl lay on the bed, engrossed in a book. The room was bathed in the soft glow of a dim reading light. Her heart fluttered with each word she devoured. The serenity of the night wrapped around her, as if the world outside had faded into oblivion.\n\n                                                    cont...","c":"Then, without warning, the lights blinked out, plunging the room into darkness. She sat up, her heart racing. Slowly, she swung her legs over the edge of the bed and hesitantly stood. Something was wrong. She couldn't shake the eerie feeling that had settled in the air.\n\nGingerly, she made her way downstairs, her bare feet meeting the cool wooden steps. Her fingers brushed along the wall, searching for the light switch, but there was no power. Panic gnawed at her as she felt her way to the fuse box.\n\nAnd then, as if an omen, a resounding bang echoed from the front door, sending a shiver down her spine. She froze, her breath caught in her throat. There was no mistaking it – that was the sound of a heavy, impatient fist. There was another crash, followed by hurried footsteps. Two intruders, from the sound of it, had invaded the home, and she was alone.\n\n“Where are you, Sarah?” one of the men called out in a raspy voice, the words a chilling caress of terror. “We just want to play with you, Sarah,” the other continued, the malicious intent lurking in their voices.\n\nIn the darkness, the two men wreaked havoc throughout the house, the cacophony of shattering belongings echoing their intrusion. Her heart pounded, she couldn't stay there, so she decided to go upstairs. Her instincts urged her to flee to safety, and she made a run for the staircase.\n\nBut as she reached the base of the stairs, one of the men grabbed her from behind. She couldn't suppress a gasp as the man pinned her to the floor. Instinct took over, and she kicked the man in the groin. He stumbled back in pain, and she managed to get to her feet. She ran up the stairs in a panic and into her bedroom.\n\nIn the bedroom, she opened the closet, pulling out a hidden gun with trembling hands. She took cover behind the bed, gun poised and ready. The footsteps drew closer, echoing through the silent house, and the door swung open. Without hesitation, she fired the gun. The deafening shot reverberated in the stillness, and the intruder fell to the floor, lifeless.\n\nShe grabbed her phone, using its flashlight to illuminate the room. A masked man lay dead on the bedroom floor. But her relief was short-lived, as the second man entered, his mask held in his trembling hand.\n\n“Sarah, please stop. This is Quentin. We are your friends. It was just a prank,” he stammered, his voice filled with desperation.\n\nShe revealed her face in the cold light of the phone. Quentin was shocked.\n\n“I'm Rose,” she replied icily, not swayed by his pleas. She shot Quentin in the leg, and he collapsed in agony. She searched him, taking away his phone. She dragged him downstairs. Opening the basement door, she flung him inside.\n\nQuentin heard whimpering from the other end of the basement. Dazed and trembling, he fumbled for a match and ignited it. In the eerie glow, his eyes met the sight of the real Sarah, gagged and chained in the basement.\n\n\n\n#continuity_by_sd\n\nWelcome to the Day 12 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e, October.\n#deception #prank #victim\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled The Secret.
