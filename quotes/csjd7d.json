{"d":"2023-11-05T05:01:22Z","t":"In the bustling streets of Mumbai, where life moved at the speed of a racing car, there existed a world unnoticed by many-a world inhabited by children like Zarif. Zarif was just a nameless face among the countless souls who fought for survival amidst the chaos of the city. He lived on the streets, a young boy forgotten by society, ignored by the rich and shooed away by the rest.\n","c":"One scorching afternoon, as Zarif rummaged through a heap of garbage, his eyes caught something unusual-a slate, discarded and forgotten, like him. The slate was old and cracked, but to Zarif, it was a treasure. His heart raced as he picked it up and dusted off the grime that had covered it.\n\nThough Zarif couldn't read or write, he had often gazed at the larger-than-life billboards that adorned the bustling streets, and he had seen newspapers sprawled on the sidewalks. The letters and words, a mysterious dance of symbols, intrigued him. With no knowledge or guidance, Zarif started imitating these letters on his newfound slate, a beggar boy's humble attempt to grasp the world he yearned to be part of. He didn't know what they meant, but the mere act of creating them filled his heart with a strange sense of accomplishment.\n\nAs Zarif continued his amateur attempts at writing, he didn't notice the young woman watching him from a distance. Her heart ached for the destitute boy, and she couldn't bear to see him left in the shadows of ignorance. She approached Zarif, smiled and said hello. Zarif was startled and scared. He thought she was going to scold him or take away his slate. He clutched it tightly and backed away.\n\nThe woman sensed Zarif's fear and tried to calm him down. She introduced herself as Garima and asked him his name. She asked him if he liked the slate and if he wanted to learn more. Zarif looked up, wide-eyed, and nodded hesitantly. His voice barely a whisper, he replied, “Yes.”\n\nFrom that day on, every afternoon, Garima would meet Zarif and teach him on the slate. She started with the basics, teaching him the alphabet and simple words. Zarif's eyes would light up with curiosity as he soaked in knowledge like a parched desert soaking up rain. It was as if a magical world had opened up before him.\n\nWith the support of an NGO, Garima gathered more underprivileged children and started teaching them as well. She used old slates like Zarif's and whatever little resources she had to provide them with an education. The once-ignored children now had hope, and the power of knowledge transformed their lives.\n\nAs the years passed, Garima never forgot that tattered slate that had started it all. She preserved it at her home, a symbol of the beginning of her mission to educate the underprivileged. On that slate, she wrote a quote that had become her guiding principle: “Magic is not just puffs and smoke; it's the power to transform lives, one small act of kindness at a time.”\n\n\n\n#continuity_by_sd\n\nWelcome to the Day 16 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e, October.\n#education #underprivileged #hope\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled The Magic Slate.
