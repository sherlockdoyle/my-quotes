{"d":"2023-07-02T06:51:30Z","t":"Once we were intertwined, a symphony of two,\nMoments shared, laughter bloomed, as our love grew,\nBut distance stood between us, a barrier unkind,\nOur love, a flame flickering, longing to find.\n","c":"As miles kept us apart, aching voids we felt,\nLonging for your touch, the warmth our hearts once dwelt,\nNow you're gone, departed, like a fleeting dove,\nLeaving behind an emptiness, a void of love.\n\nIn solitary hours, I gaze at your face,\nPictures captured in frames, preserving moments' grace,\nI trace the lines of your smile, your eyes shining bright,\nDreaming of the day we reunite, in love's sweet light.\n\nBut time's relentless march continues its sway,\nAnd I'm left here yearning, longing for yesterday,\nI miss the echoes of your laughter, your embrace,\nThe whispered promises that time can't erase.\n\nLost in daydream, I wander through the night,\nDreams of you enfold me, holding me so tight,\nIn slumber's realm, your presence feels so real,\nWhispered words and tender touches, I can feel.\n\nA flicker of hope lingers, a fragile ray,\nThat someday our paths may cross, love's debt to repay,\nUntil then, I'll hold onto memories so true,\nBut deep inside, the doubt persists, \"Who am I to you?\"\n\n\n\nInspired by \"Time Does Not Bring Relief\" by Edna St. Vincent Millay.\n\n\nHere's your prompt for the Day 25 of Writing Sprints. Collab and write a poem that ends with the line \"Who am I to you?\"\n\nNot a collab, but who cares! #writingsprint #whoamitoyoupoem #distance #memories #picture #dreams #past #emptiness","f":"i","l":["pot","lov"],"h":"https://www.yourquote.in/sherlock-doyle-9qp8/quotes/once-intertwined-symphony-two-moments-shared-laughter-our-us-crka06","p":"crj1r4","n":"crkmh2"}
