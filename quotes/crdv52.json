{"d":"2023-06-11T07:09:25Z","t":"It was well past midnight when I returned home from the long-awaited meet-up with my old friends. The deserted city streets were eerily quiet, with dim streetlights casting long shadows on the pavement and the windows of the houses in the neighborhood dimly lit. As I approached my house, a flicker of light caught my attention from the corner of my eye. Looking at the neighboring house, I noticed a faint glow from the windows.\n\n                                                                 cont...","c":"Curiosity mixed with concern, I couldn't help but be drawn to the soft light that spilled from the windows. Through the sheer curtains, I glimpsed a shadowy figure of a girl inside. Could it be my neighbor returning after her unexplained absence? Or was it someone else entirely?\n\nThe silhouette had long, flowing hair, reminding me of the missing girl, the one who had mysteriously disappeared and was rumored to have met an unfortunate end. Conflicting thoughts agitated my mind. Was this a figment of my imagination or a glimpse into a chilling reality? My heart raced with concern and intrigue. What was she doing in there at this hour? I contemplated whether to intervene or dismiss it as a trick of the light. However, my instinct urged me to investigate.\n\nWith hesitant steps, I crossed the narrow space separating our houses, the soft crunch of gravel beneath my feet seemingly amplified in the stillness of the night. Reaching the neighbor's front door, I raised my hand, trembling slightly, to knock.\n\nTo my surprise, the door swung open easily, revealing a dark and empty interior. Stepping inside cautiously, my eyes darted around, searching for any sign of the mysterious girl I had seen moments ago. I switched on the lights, but the house appeared vacant. Confusion washed over me as I surveyed the room, searching for any trace of the mysterious girl.\n\nAs I ventured further into the house, an eerie silence descended, broken only by the creaking of floorboards beneath my weight. Each room I entered appeared untouched, as if time had frozen within its walls. The air grew heavy, carrying the faint scent of old books and lavender. With each step, a sense of unease gnawed at me, as if invisible eyes were watching my every move. Undeterred, I pressed on, determined to unravel the unfolding mystery. However, no matter how many rooms I searched, there was no trace of the girl I had seen.\n\n\n\n#fragments_by_sd #shadow #girl #illusion\n\nWelcome to the day 13 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e. May. \n\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled #areyouserious.
