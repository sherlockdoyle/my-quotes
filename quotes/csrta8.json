Her gaze fell on the imposing time machine in the corner, its metallic surface gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights. A jolt of fear shot through her as the events of the previous night came flooding back.\n\n                                                        cont...","c":"She had been working on the time machine with her husband's best friend, a brilliant but eccentric scientist. He had convinced her to take a test run, and she had foolishly agreed. Now, she was alone, with no memory of what had happened after stepping into the machine.\n\nPanic began to rise in her chest. She had to find a way back, back to her own time, back to her own life. Barely able to stand, she stumbled into the time machine. Her eyes scanned the rows of buttons and switches, searching for the one her friend had pressed. Finally, she spotted it and with a deep breath, she pressed it. The capacitor sparked and suddenly everything turned black.\n\nEdna woke up with a dull throb in her head. The room was unfamiliar, and the last thing she remembered was being at a comedy club laughing at comedian Alex's jokes. Hadn't she been working on the time machine prototype with her boss just a while back? Panic surged through her as she scanned the room, but he was nowhere to be seen. Just then, her gaze fell on the imposing time machine, its metallic surface gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights. A desperate resolve settled over her. She had to get back, back to the time and place where she belonged. With shaking hands, she climbed into the machine and located the familiar button her boss had pressed earlier. As her finger made contact, the capacitor sparked and suddenly everything turned black.\n\nEdna woke up with a dull throb in her head. Her head swam as she tried to recall the details, memories filtering through like a hazy dream. The last clear image was Charles, the renowned photographer, capturing her essence with his lens. But where was she now? Looking around, she found herself in the sterile confines of a lab, a giant time machine looming in the corner. A chilling sense of deja vu washed over her, as if these very events had unfolded before, yet with different details. Was this a trick of her mind, or was this a repeated loop of her own making? With a resolute heart, Edna approached the time machine, her gaze fixed on the button she had pressed countless times before. A single click, and once again, the capacitor sparked and suddenly everything turned black.\n\nEdna woke up with a dull throb in her head. The sterile walls of the lab and the imposing time machine in the corner triggered a surge of chilling familiarity. Hadn't she just been here, living the same scene over and over again? Yet, the memories felt different, fragments of a boy finding a wallet on the sidewalk flickering in her mind. Fear gnawed at her, the repetition making her question the very fabric of reality. With a trembling hand, she approached the time machine, the destination unknown but the journey inevitable. As she pressed the familiar button, the capacitor sparked and suddenly everything turned black.\n\nEdna woke up with a dull throb in her head. The white walls, the sterile air, and the imposing time machine in the corner - it was like a recurring nightmare. But this time, the memories were different. This time, it wasn't a comedian's performance, nor a rendezvous with a photographer. This time, she remembered working with her boss on the time machine prototype.\n\nShe remembered her boss had warned her about the potential side effects, the possibility of creating multiple timelines. Each timeline would be slightly different, each with its own set of events and memories. A chilling realization dawned upon her. The deja vu, the fragmented memories, the repetition of events - it was all a symptom of the fractured time-space continuum. Each time she woke up in the lab, it was a different dimension, a slightly altered reality.\n\nEdna had her mission, to mend the fractured timeline; to go back to the branch in time to close the loops, and to reclaim her rightful place in a single, unified reality. With newfound purpose, she approached the time machine. Her touch on the control panel felt strangely familiar, as if she had done this countless times before. With a single click, the capacitor sparked and suddenly everything turned black.\n\nEdna woke up with a dull throb in her head. This time, a new memory surfaced - a playful cat nuzzling her hand. Yet, unlike the previous loops, the new memory didn't cause panic. Instead, it fueled her resolve. She knew what she had to do: close the loops. And so she did, again and again. Each loop brought a new memory, a new facet of a life she never lived: a terrorist attack, another time loop, the heartbreak of a bitter divorce. The question gnawed at her - how many loops were there? Was it an infinite descent into madness, each loop branching off into more and more possibilities? Was this her fate, an endless cycle of memories and realities? Was this her end? Perhaps this was A End for Edna, at least in this dimension.\n\n\n\nThat was Continuity, a collection of 31 short stories that's connected by some thread, probably.
