Whenever he tried to talk to others or join a group, they would laugh at him and say mean things. They gave him nicknames that made fun of him and made him feel alone.\n\n                                                          cont...","c":"With a heavy heart, he went to his classroom, preparing himself for another day of being treated badly. When he entered, he could hear whispers following him, filled with cruel words. They called him names like \"Loner\" and \"Outcast\", making sure he felt left out. The bullies enjoyed being mean to him, teasing him with their words and making him feel like he didn't belong.\n\nUnable to handle the mockery anymore, the boy decided to ask his teacher for help. One day, with tears running down his face, he gathered the courage to talk to the teacher, pouring out his feelings and asking for assistance. The teacher listened, but merely offered empty reassurances.\n\n“Everything will get better,” the teacher said with a dismissive smile. “Just give it some time.”\n\nAs time went on, the situation got even worse. The girls who had bullied him found out he tried to get help, and they used it against him. They called him a \"Crybaby\" and made fun of him even more. The boy felt hurt by their words, realizing that asking for help had made things worse. He felt more alone and withdrew even further into himself, losing hope of finding comfort or understanding.\n\n---\n\nI slowly sit up, feeling a bit confused as if I just woke up from a dream. As I look around the room, it sinks in that I'm alone, trapped in this empty place. The walls feel like they're closing in on me, silently judging me. I need to escape, to break free from this suffocating loneliness.\n\nI approach the door, my hands shaking with anticipation. I push hard, trying to open it, but it won't budge. Frustration builds inside me, I've to find a way to escape. A dim ray of light shines through the barred window, illuminating the room.\n\nAn idea comes to me—I can escape through that window. I examine the planks, seeing that they look old and worn. They seem weak, like they've been neglected for years. Hope fills my heart as I imagine the possibility of finally getting out.\n\n\n\n#fragments_by_sd #loneliness #neglect #helpless\n\nWelcome to the day 23 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e. May. \n\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled #nickname.
