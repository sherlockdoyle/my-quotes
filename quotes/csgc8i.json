{"d":"2023-10-24T08:26:35Z","t":"I have been a silent witness to the passage of time, hanging on the wall of the living room, my elegant design and soothing chimes a testament to fine craftsmanship. I was once a symbol of love and harmony, a precious gift to Julia and Kevin on their wedding day. But now they are breaking up. They are signing the divorce papers on the coffee table, barely looking at each other. They are trying to act calm and civil, but I can sense the anger and pain in their voices.","c":"I remember when Julia and Kevin first brought me home. I was a gift for their marriage. They were so happy and in love then. They hung me on the wall and admired my elegant design and soothing chimes. They said I would be a perfect addition to their cozy home.\n\nThey used to spend a lot of time together in this room, watching movies, playing games, or just cuddling on the couch. They would laugh and kiss and whisper sweet nothings to each other. They would look at me and smile, knowing that they had all the time in the world to enjoy each other's company.\n\nBut things changed over the years. The first sign of trouble was Julia's frequent work-related absences. She was an ambitious woman, chasing her career dreams. She said it was important for her career and that she loved her husband very much. She said she would always come back to him.\n\nBut Kevin yearned for her presence. He was lonely and bored. He missed his wife terribly and felt neglected by her. It wasn't long before Kevin's solitude started to affect him. He found solace in the company of Lily, a coworker with a warm smile who offered him companionship and a listening ear. She was young and pretty and friendly. She made him feel alive and appreciated.\n\nIt wasn't long before Julia discovered her husband's emotional affair. She was furious and hurt. She confronted her husband and they had a huge fight. They shouted and cried and threw things at each other. Some of them barely missed me. They said things they did not mean and could not take back. I watched as their love deteriorated day by day.\n\nJulia and Kevin decided to give their marriage one last chance. Julia had to go abroad for work for a year. She said it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that she could not refuse it. She said they should give the distance a try and see if they could work things out. She said she still loved her husband and hoped he would wait for her.\n\nKevin agreed reluctantly. He said he was sorry for what he had done and that he wanted to save their marriage. He said he loved his wife and would try to be faithful to her.\n\nDuring that year, they tried their best to make it work, bridging the gap with late-night calls and tearful apologies. I counted the days on my face, marking the slow passage of time. But nothing worked. The distance only made them drift further apart. They lost interest and trust in each other. They realized they had nothing in common anymore. It became apparent that the chasm between them was unbridgeable.\n\nNow, Julia and Kevin stand on the precipice of a final decision. They are now deciding who gets to keep what from their shared belongings. They are arguing over the furniture, the appliances, the books, the paintings, the souvenirs...\n\nAnd me.\n\nThey look at me with mixed emotions. I am a reminder of their happy past, but also of their bitter present. They're trying to choose the memories they want to keep and the ones they'd rather leave behind. Perhaps neither of them will want me anymore, and I'll be left to gather dust or be discarded.\n\nI do not know what will happen to me. I am just an old clock. And I am running out of time.\n\n\n\n#continuity_by_sd\n\nWelcome to the Day 9 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e, October.\n#love #separation #loneliness\nToday, write a #shortstory titled The Old Clock.
