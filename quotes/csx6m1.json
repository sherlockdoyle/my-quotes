My aunt Tara, who's as simple and down-to-earth as they come, and maybe a tad bit crazy, tied the knot with a guy who could easily pass for my grandpa. No kidding! And you know what? My mom's side of the family was over the moon. I mean, why wouldn't they be? They finally had the chance to bid adieu to the trouble that is Tara. So, they went all out, arranging the wedding with a kind of enthusiasm you wouldn't believe.\n\nNow, let me tell you about aunt Tara. She wasn't exactly tall, and beauty queens would have nothing to worry about. She had this brown skin that was as earthy as her personality. Her hair, slightly curled and shoulder-length, was a constant battleground for lice. But hey, it was all part of her charm.\n\nAnd then there were her teeth. Oh boy, those two front teeth! They were relatively big and would make their grand appearance every time she flashed one of her smiles. It was like they had a spotlight of their own. But you know what? It was Tara, and we wouldn't have her any other way.\n\nBut here's the kicker. Despite all her quirks and eccentricities, Tara was a wizard in the kitchen. I mean, she could whip up a storm with her cooking skills. It was like her superpower. So, yeah, she might have been a bit unconventional, but she sure knew her way around a pot and a pan.\n\nHere's the funny part. I don't even know her actual name. As a kid, I was taught to call her by a nickname in my native tongue, which, when translated to English, means 'youngest aunt'. That's what I used to call her whenever I visited my grandparents and met her.\n\nNow, here's the catch. She wasn't the youngest of her siblings. Not by a long shot. But somehow, she ended up with that name. It's one of those family mysteries that no one quite has an answer to. But then again, that's what makes it all the more endearing, doesn't it? After all, it's these little quirks and eccentricities that make a family, well, a family.\n\nMy grandparents had a big family, eight daughters and two sons to be exact. It was a lot of mouths to feed and in those days, they weren't exactly swimming in wealth. So, they made a tough decision. They sent their eldest daughters to work as full-time maids in people's houses. It was a common practice back then, a way for poor families to make ends meet.\n\nAunt Tara was among those who were sent away. She was young and probably scared, but she did what she had to do. She worked in a house where she was treated well enough. She cooked, cleaned, and did all the household chores. She became an integral part of their household, so much so that when her employers decided to move to the city, they took aunt Tara with them.\n\nAnd then, just like that, there was no news of her. Life moved on, as it always does. My mother grew up, and got married. My Uncle, too, found his footing in the world. He learned a trade, earned a living. We were born, the next generation of the family. Uncle got married, adding another member to our ever-growing clan.\n\nBut life wasn't all rosy. Grandfather passed away, succumbing to illness and grief. His absence was a void that couldn't be filled. And grandmother, oh dear grandmother, she bore the brunt of it all. Every time I visited, I would often find her in a corner, her face hidden in the folds of her white saree, crying for her lost daughter.\n\nThen one day, out of the blue, Uncle got news of aunt Tara's whereabouts. He wasted no time and brought her home. The moment she stepped through the door, grandma rushed to her. She hugged her long-lost daughter tightly, tears streaming down her face. “Look at you,” she cried, “how big you've grown!”\n\nAunt Tara just patted her mother's head and gave her a smile, her teeth peeking out from her lips. It was a sight to behold, her return. We were all surprised, curious even. But for that moment, all that mattered was that aunt Tara was home.\n\nAnd aunt Tara didn't come home empty-handed. After years of hard work, she had managed to save up a considerable amount of wealth. She brought back clothes, some jewellery, and even toys for us. It was like she had brought a piece of the city back with her.\n\nUs cousins, we were like bees around a honey pot. We couldn't help ourselves. We were always around her bags, checking and rechecking. Each time we opened them, it felt like we were discovering a new world, a world that aunt Tara had been a part of. It was a strange feeling, but also exciting. After all, how often do you get to touch and feel the life of someone you had only heard stories about? It was a good time, a time of discovery and joy.\n\nAs long as aunt Tara had money, she was the golden girl. Everyone loved her, everyone wanted to be around her. But when Uncle used up all her savings for the family, things started to change. Not that aunt Tara minded, she was happy to help. But the love that everyone had for her, it started to fade.\n\nUncle's wife, who had always been a bit standoffish, began to reduce her workload. She started spending more time sitting, leaving aunt Tara to pick up the slack. Even grandma, who had always been aunt Tara's biggest supporter, seemed to be angry with her. It was a tough time for aunt Tara, but she bore it all with a smile.\n\nAnd so, aunt Tara became the workhorse of the family. She'd be up at the crack of dawn, cleaning the house, cooking for everyone, doing the laundry. She even took on the responsibility of taking Uncle's kid to and from school. And let's not forget about Uncle's wife, who had aunt Tara oiling her hair and massaging her head like she was some kind of personal assistant.\n\nBut aunt Tara, bless her heart, she did it all with a smile on her face. That silly aunt Tara, always trying to keep everyone happy. But you know what they say about no good deed going unpunished. Even with all that she was doing, the slightest mistake and she'd get an earful. It was a tough gig, but that's just how things were back then.\n\nThen came the day aunt Tara was going to get married. Uncle, ever the frugal one, decorated the house with paper flowers and banana trees bought on the cheap. But you know what, it didn't look half bad. Uncle's wife, my mom, and the other aunts, they all dolled up in bright red and white sarees, their foreheads adorned with big streaks of vermilion. It was a sight to behold.\n\nAnd the welcome they gave their new brother-in-law, boy oh boy, it was something else. Fruits, sweets, water, you name it, they had it all. It was a grand old time, a time of celebration and joy.\n\nAunt Tara, she was over the moon about getting married. You could see it in her eyes, the happiness, the excitement. But us cousins, we weren't too thrilled about the groom. The man was old, so old that he came with his niece and nephew who were already married and some even had their own kids.\n\nHe was dressed in a white dhoti and punjabi, with streaks of sandalwood smeared across his forehead. He was bald, wore a topor, and had almost no teeth. His hands and feet were wrinkled, showing the signs of a long life lived. When you saw him, you couldn't help but call him a grandpa.\n\nThe groom, he was a widower. After his wife's death, he had grown too alone. Even his own sons didn't look after him. So, his niece and nephew, they decided to get him married again. They thought he needed someone to look after him during his old age.\n\nAnd you know what, it wasn't a bad idea. It was actually good for both the man and aunt Tara. He got someone to take care of him, and aunt Tara, she got a family, a place where she was needed. It was a win-win situation, really.\n\nDespite our reservations, he tried to win us over. He called us over and gave us chocolates. We took them, more out of politeness than anything else. It was a strange time, a time of change. But through it all, aunt Tara kept smiling. That's just the kind of person she was.\n\nEven after the marriage, during the farewell, aunt Tara didn't shed a tear. It was unusual, you know. Most brides cry at their farewell, overwhelmed by the emotions of leaving their family and starting a new life. But not aunt Tara. She walked towards her new life, holding her husband's hand, with a smile on her face. It was a genuine smile, one that reached her eyes.\n\nWhenever our new uncle visited, he always brought gifts for us. Aunt Tara would light up at first, her eyes sparkling with joy as she saw us unwrapping the presents. But as time went on, I noticed a change. Her smiles became less frequent, less genuine. It was as if a cloud had cast a shadow over her happiness.\n\nI remember overhearing hushed conversations between my mother and aunts. They would gather in the kitchen, their voices barely above a whisper. The word on everyone's lips was that aunt Tara wasn't happy in her marriage. The reason? She couldn't have children. Our new uncle was just too old. It was a harsh reality that she had to face.\n\nBut you know what? The man loved aunt Tara more than anything. He was crazy for her. I mean, head over heels in love. You could see it in his eyes every time he looked at her. It was as if she was the only person in the world for him. And whenever we called him, wanting to talk to aunt Tara, we could hear the affection in his voice as he called out her name. He used to work in a shoe store. It wasn't a glamorous job, but he was content. The money wasn't much, but it was enough for both of them. They lived a simple life, but they were happy.\n\nOne day aunt Tara's husband came home from work in the middle of the day. He walked in, looking a bit off, and called out to her, “Tara, could you get me a glass of water, please?” His voice was weak.\n\nBy the time aunt Tara returned with the water, she found her husband collapsed on the floor, clutching his chest. The glass slipped from her hand, shattering into a million pieces as she rushed to his side. She cradled him in her arms, tears streaming down her face, but it was too late. His eyes had already closed, his hand had already gone limp in hers. And all she could do was cry.\n\nWe all made our way to uncle's house. The place was filled with a heavy silence, broken only by aunt Tara's heart-wrenching sobs. She was there in the courtyard, crying over her husband's lifeless body. Two widows from the neighborhood held her back, their faces etched with sympathy and understanding.\n\nThey took her hands, the bangles she wore clinking against each other. With a swift, practiced motion, they broke the bangles against a stone. Aunt Tara didn't resist, she just kept crying. Then, they reached up and gently rubbed off the vermilion from aunt Tara's forehead, the bright red powder staining their fingers. They poured water over her, washing away the remnants of her married life. Finally, they helped her out of her colorful clothes. In their place, they draped her in a white saree.\n\nOur old uncle had a small piece of land and a house, nothing fancy, but it was home. After his death, his sons sold them off, saying it was for their father's rituals. But we all knew the truth. They just wanted to wash their hands off any responsibility, especially when it came to aunt Tara.\n\nThey made it clear, in no uncertain terms, that they wouldn't take any responsibility for her. It was like she was suddenly invisible to them, a burden they didn't want to bear. And it wasn't just them. Even my Uncle's wife turned her back on aunt Tara. She flat out refused to let her stay in their house.\n\nAnd just like that, aunt Tara, a bit out of her mind, maybe, was alone once more. Uncle took her back to where he had found her, to the place she had called home before all this. He left her there, amidst the familiar surroundings, but everything felt different now. It was like she was seeing it all for the first time, through the lens of her newfound loneliness.\n\nAunt Tara had tasted happiness, if only for a while. She had known what it felt like to be loved, to be cared for. She had been part of a family, had a place she could call home. But in an instant, it was all gone. She lost everything, her home, her family, and her sense of belonging.\n\n\n\nBackground created with Dall-E.\n\n\n#stories_of_home_world_by_sd is a collection of real life stories that I've seen around me or have heard.
