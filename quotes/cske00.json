He opened his eyes slowly, taking in the familiar sight of his room. The same room he had lived in for the past twenty-five years. The same room that had witnessed his joys and sorrows, his hopes and fears, his dreams and nightmares.\n\n                                                          cont...","c":"But something was different today. Something had changed. Xavier felt a sense of relief washing over him, a lightness in his chest that he had never experienced before. He felt free. Free from the burden that had weighed him down for so long. Free from the shadow that had loomed over him for as long as he could remember.\n\nHis mother had passed away the previous night.\n\nYou might think it strange, even heartless, for Xavier to feel a sense of relief on such a day. You might expect him to feel grief, sorrow, guilt, or anger. But you see, Xavier's relationship with his mother was far from ordinary.\n\nHe had always felt trapped by her presence. His mother was a perfectionist, and she expected nothing less from him. She wanted him to be the best at everything, to excel in every field, to achieve every goal. She wanted him to be perfect. Just like others.\n\nXavier never knew his father. His mother never spoke of him, and Xavier was too afraid to ask. He had learned early on that asking questions was a sign of weakness, of curiosity, of disobedience. His childhood was a series of instructions and reprimands - “Do this my way,” “Don't do that,” “Why can't you be more like others?” - a never-ending quest for perfection that left him feeling inadequate and unappreciated.\n\nEven as he grew older, his mother's overprotective nature didn't wane. She didn't allow him to move out, to live his life. She controlled every aspect of his existence, from his education to his career, from his friends to his hobbies, from his diet to his clothes. Xavier felt like a bird in a gilded cage, his every move scrutinized, his every action judged. His life was not his own; it was a reflection of his mother's unattainable standards of perfection.\n\nBut now, he was free. He was no longer under the constant watch of his mother, no longer had to strive for the unattainable perfection she demanded. He had finally done something that she couldn't control. He had tied the noose perfectly, pushed the chair away, and asked his mother one last time if everything was perfect now. He had asked her if she was proud of him now.\n\nXavier was finally free. Free from the shackles of perfection, free from the prison his mother had built around him. He could finally live his life the way he wanted to, without the constant fear of not being good enough. He could finally breathe.\n\nAnd so, Xavier stepped into the world, a world that was his own. A world where he could make his own choices, live his life on his own terms. He was no longer trapped. He was free.\n\n\n\nInspired by Por Thozhil by Vignesh Raja.\n\n\n#continuity_by_sd\n\nWelcome to the Day 20 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e, October.\n#perfectionism #murder #freedom\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled Trapped.
