{"d":"2023-11-18T17:31:56Z","t":"Mohan felt a pang of guilt as he looked at his father's portrait. He had died suddenly, leaving behind a mountain of debt and a son who resented him. The somber atmosphere in the house weighed heavily on Mohan's shoulders as relatives and creditors gathered to pay their last respects. It seemed like an unusual congregation of sorrow, and Mohan couldn't shake off the feeling that beneath the veneer of mourning, everyone was anxious about their money.","c":"Determined to fulfill his promise, Mohan addressed the creditors, “Come tomorrow morning and tell me how much you get.” His voice, though laden with grief, carried a resolute tone. He was not well-to-do, and the burden of his father's financial obligations loomed large. Yet, he refused to let anyone bear the weight of his father's debts.\n\nAs the night wore on, Mohan found himself alone in the dimly lit room, surrounded by the echoes of unsaid words and unresolved conflicts with his late father. It was only a few days ago when Mohan had angrily confronted his father about his seemingly selfish approach to life. “What are your plans for my future? You only think of yourself!” Mohan had shouted in anger. His father, calm as always, had assured him that he would get what he deserved when the time was right.\n\nThe morning sun cast a somber light on the gathering in his home. The creditors arrived one by one, their expressions a mix of sympathy and anticipation. Mohan braced himself for the inevitable financial reckoning.\n\nTo his surprise, the first visitors were from the bank. They revealed that his father had diligently saved, squirreling away small amounts over the years. The modest savings had grown into a substantial sum. As the day unfolded, others followed suit, each bearing similar news. His father, it seemed, had invested wisely in various schemes, leaving Mohan with more than he had ever imagined. The debts that had seemed insurmountable now appeared manageable, thanks to his father's foresight.\n\nAs Mohan counted the money that would free him from the shackles of debt, he couldn't help but feel a bittersweet mix of emotions. Now, standing amidst the unexpected wealth, Mohan realized the truth behind his father's words. The time was right, the money was there, but his father was gone. The unspoken goodbye hung heavy in the air-a farewell never uttered but deeply felt.\n\n\n\n#continuity_by_sd\n\nWelcome to the Day 25 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e, October.\n#debt #inheritance #regret\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled Unsaid Goodbye.
