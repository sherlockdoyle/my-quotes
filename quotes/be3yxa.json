My father had passed away when I was a kid.\n\nI saw Teddy with my mom ever since I was a kid. Back then he used to sit on the fireplace, but mom soon moved him into her bedroom when I started fearing him. Teddy was old, and when you tilted its head, it used to emit a haunting growl. Everything about Teddy appeared to haunt me.\n\nThis might be hard to believe, but when you were near Teddy, you needed to be respectful. You were not allowed to raise your voice or use slang. It seemed that his beady eyes were always following you. Even my mom would soften her voice when around Teddy. Once she dropped a glass near Teddy, but after cleaning up, she apologized for the incident. Apologized to Teddy.\n\nWhen I was seven, there was a knock on the door one night. When my mom opened the door, three masked men burst inside carrying guns. One of them hit my mom on her head, and she became unconscious. In my terror, I hadn’t realized when I had hugged Teddy.\n\n“Is that your teddy bear?” one of the men grinned and slapped me. I was on the verge of tears and placed Teddy silently on the fireplace. Another man pushed me towards a wall. I fell upon the wall and kept standing facing the wall, trembling with fear knowing that something terrible was gonna happen.\n\n“Stupid kid,” one of the men said, “now let’s see where the money is hidden.”\n\nThen Teddy growled, that haunting growl. I tried my best to block the noises. Ever since then I’ve tried to forget everything.\n\nThe police never caught the killer. My mom was unconscious and I was not much help as a witness. The three intruders were found in the most gruesome situation possible. It appeared as if they were ironed and folded like clothes. The only difference is that clothes don’t scream and beg the entire time.\nApart from that, there was no mess – it appeared that the crime scene was thoroughly cleaned. Although no one noticed the small drop of blood on Teddy’s eye.\n\n\n\n#teddybear #toy #alive #protect #revenge #intruder #saviour #kill","f":"i","l":["hor","lif"],"h":"https://www.yourquote.in/sherlock-doyle-9qp8/quotes/teddy-be3yxa","p":"beyzzr","n":"be9kyr"}
