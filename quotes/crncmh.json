Despite the monster's fearsome appearance, it wasn't just trying to hurt him, but it seemed more interested in attacking the girl.\n\nOliver's weary eyes opened wide as he realized the truth about the girl. She fought fiercely, but only to protect herself without thinking of Oliver. Her motives were selfish, and she didn't care about what might happen because of her actions.\n                                                          cont...","c":"Feeling weak and tired, Oliver couldn't keep fighting. He was exhausted and knew it was pointless. He made a tough decision and lay down, watching as the monster and the girl continued their struggle.\n\nEven though Oliver was weak, he kept his eyes on the fight. He saw the monster fight back, but with restraint. It seemed to understand what the girl was really like and wanted to protect Oliver from her destructive influence.\n\nAs the fight continued, Oliver witnessed the monster becoming stronger, overpowering the girl's determined efforts. In the final moment, the creature's power proved unbeatable, and it emerged victorious against the girl's cruelty. Her suffering finally ended as the monster defeated her completely.\n\nThen, the victorious monster approached Oliver with kind and caring eyes. It knew that Oliver had fought for the right reasons. The monster had been trying to save Oliver from the girl.\n\nAnd so, when the sun rose on the horizon, filling the hospital room with its warm glow, Oliver woke up. He was sore, but he was alive. His parents were there, smiling with relief. They had been worried about him and were happy to hear that the girl had been defeated.\n\nYou see, Oliver had been fighting a tough battle inside him—leukemia. For months, he had gone through hard chemotherapy treatments, fighting bravely to beat the most common type of cancer that affects children. The treatments made him weak and tired, but he faced his battle with the same courage he showed in the magical forest. Finally, he won the fight as the chemotherapy beat the disease. Oliver was free from leukemia and had a new chance at life.\n\n\n\n#victory #cancer #monster #mislead #truenature #safe #chemotherapy\n\nThat was #dreamlore1.
