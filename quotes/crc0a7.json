The police's questioning about the missing girl had left me disoriented and unsettled. As evening fell, I reached for my medicine, hoping it would calm my restless mind. As I sat in silence, a subtle yet distinct scent of lavender drifted through the air, filling the room. It was as if a gentle breeze carried the fragrance, captivating my senses.\n\n                                                                 cont...","c":"Startled, I looked around, my eyes darting from corner to corner, searching for the source of the mysterious scent. A chill crept up my spine as a soft, ethereal voice whispered, \"Help me,\" delicate yet urgent. Fear gripped my heart, rendering me momentarily speechless. But then, mustering courage, I responded, my voice trembling, \"Who... who are you? What do you want?\"\n\nThe room remained silent, as if the ghostly presence contemplated its response. And then, a faint figure materialized before me—a young woman, ethereal and translucent, wearing a sundress. Her eyes were filled with sadness and longing. It was the missing girl's ghost, reaching out from beyond, seeking comfort and help.\n\nWith a mix of fear and curiosity, I leaned closer, the weight of her words heavy in the air. She explained that she had been murdered, her life cruelly taken before its time. The truth of her untimely demise burdened her spirit, trapping her between life and death. She was desperate for justice and closure. She pleaded with me, her voice laced with vulnerability. I was her only friend, her only hope to help unravel the mystery surrounding her death and bring her killer to justice.\n\nAs I listened, compassion swelled within me, overriding my fear. It was an honor, albeit a daunting one, to be chosen as the confidant of a spirit seeking peace in the afterlife. Determination sparked in my eyes as I pledged to do whatever I could to assist her.\n\nBut before she could reveal any crucial information about her killer, the ghostly figure began to fade, dissipating into the ether. Panic gripped me as I reached out, desperately trying to hold on to her presence. \"Wait, don't go! Tell me more!\" I pleaded, my voice filled with desperation. Yet, she vanished, leaving me alone once again, surrounded by the lingering scent of lavender. The weight of the task ahead settled upon my shoulders, mixed with urgency and purpose. I vowed to continue her quest, to seek justice for the girl who had become my ghostly friend.\n\n\n\n#fragments_by_sd #help #afterlife #murder\n\nWelcome to the day 10 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e. May. \n\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled #theghostfriend.
