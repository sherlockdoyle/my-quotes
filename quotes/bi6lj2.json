Unfortunately, it's pretty limited – it just traps you in the past, which you can't change.\n\n\n\nEssentially, it's just\n   like regret, but\nwith more buttons.\n","c":"Regret is a feeling of sadness, repentance, or disappointment over an occurrence or something that one has done or failed to do. It makes us sad or angry over something that we could have done differently.\nBut what's the point of regret? It's not like we can change the past and hope for a different outcome! Why mourn over it, that which can't be changed?\nEverybody's got regrets. I regret not talking to her. I regret deleting her number. But that can not change. It's best to look forward and hope for the best future.\n\n\n\n#time #machine #past #trapped #helpless #regret #sad #overcome","f":"i","l":["lif","mgs"],"h":"https://www.yourquote.in/sherlock-doyle-9qp8/quotes/i-ve-been-building-time-machine-quite-now-unfortunately-it-s-bi6lj2","p":"bi1gu9","n":"bjai1n"}
