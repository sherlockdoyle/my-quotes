{"d":"2023-10-29T08:06:17Z","t":"Tyler had just moved into a new neighborhood, and like any sane, paranoid person, he immediately started suspecting that his neighbor, Mr. Ulrich, was a serial killer. I mean, it wasn't entirely baseless. Tyler had seen some pretty peculiar things happening next door.\n\n\n                                                         cont...","c":"First of all, Mr. Ulrich seemed to have a nocturnal lifestyle. He would return home at the oddest hours, like 3 AM, looking like he had just come back from a midnight zombie apocalypse. Tyler was convinced that he was out there burying bodies under the moonlight. He pictured him with a shovel, a flashlight, and a checklist of graves to visit, while bats circled overhead.\n\nThen there were the garbage bags. Tyler couldn't help but notice that they were unusually heavy and, well, quite leaky. They dripped this suspicious, red liquid, and sometimes he swore he saw bones poking out. It was like a DIY horror movie in the making. Tyler's imagination went wild, and he envisioned those bags oozing body parts, haunted by restless spirits.\n\nStrange noises resonated from the Ulrich residence too. Thumps, bangs, and muffled cries that sounded like the helpless pleas of Tyler's imaginary victims. He was sure he could hear chainsaws and shovels in the darkness, all part of a diabolical orchestra of doom conducted by Mr. Ulrich himself.\n\nAnd let's not forget the eerie smells wafting through the neighborhood. It was like a cross between a morgue and a spice market, which was an odd combination to say the least. In Tyler's imagination, the aromas were the byproduct of sinister alchemical concoctions that could resurrect the dead, or perhaps the souls of Mr. Ulrich's unfortunate victims ascending to haunt the living.\n\nOne fateful evening, Tyler decided he'd had enough. With the courage of a thousand horror movie protagonists, he marched over to Mr. Ulrich's front door. He knocked, and it felt like an eternity before the door creaked open.\n\nThere stood Mr. Ulrich, his eyes red from exhaustion, and he was wearing an apron that looked like it had seen a bloodbath. Tyler's heart raced. This was it; he was about to confront the neighborhood killer.\n\n\"Uh, hi,\" Tyler stuttered, trying to keep his voice steady. \"I couldn't help but notice some, um, strange things happening around here, and, well... What's with the bloody apron?\"\n\nMr. Ulrich chuckled. \"Oh, the apron! Well, you see, I was experimenting with tomato sauce and various ingredients. It just got a bit messy. It's just tomato sauce.\"\n\nTyler's jaw dropped. Tomato sauce? Was this the world's messiest spaghetti chef? \"Tomato sauce?\"\n\nMr. Ulrich nodded enthusiastically. \"Yes! You see, I'm a chef, and I work long hours at the restaurant. I like to experiment with different recipes when I get home. It's my passion. That's what those strange hours, garbage bags, and noises are all about.\"\n\nInside Tyler's head, the gruesome slideshow of horror scenes was replaced by absurd images of Mr. Ulrich gleefully tossing tomatoes like hand grenades into a kitchen battlefield, with pasta flying in every direction.\n\n\"Okay,\" Tyler said, trying to wrap his head around it. \"But what about the, uh, smells?\"\n\nMr. Ulrich chuckled. \"Well, when you cook as much as I do, the smells tend to linger. Sometimes, it's a bit overpowering, I admit. But I promise you, there's nothing sinister going on here.\"\n\nTyler blinked. He felt like he had just walked into a sitcom episode gone wrong. \"Wow,\" he said slowly. \"You're quite the mad scientist of cooking, aren't you?\"\n\nMr. Ulrich smiled proudly. \"Why thank you! That's very kind of you to say.\"\n\nTyler nodded awkwardly. He decided it was time to end this conversation before it got any weirder. \"Well,\" he said hastily. \"It was nice meeting you, Mr. Ulrich.\"\n\n\"Likewise,\" Mr. Ulrich said cheerfully.\n\nTyler turned around and walked back to his house as fast as he could. He vowed never to bother Mr. Ulrich again. He also vowed never to eat spaghetti again.\n\n\n\n#continuity_by_sd\n\nWelcome to the Day 13 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e, October.\n#mystery #misunderstanding #humour\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled The Killer Next Door.
