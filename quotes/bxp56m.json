From then, every day was the same; I was strapped and tortured psychologically every day. I started behaving like a madman, wishing to be rescued.\n\nThen one-day things changed, my captor unstrapped me. This was the moment I was waiting for, he never got a chance. I forced him on the chair and strapped him, he never protested. What a fool to let me free.\n\nI took whatever I could find and started beating him up, but he just smiled. Oh, what a psycho, I thought. But I was happy, even more, cause I could hear police sirens approaching.\n\nThe men in uniform rushed in; as they put me in handcuffs and rescued my captor, everything started falling in place. Why he unstrapped me, why he was laughing and how the police found this location.","c":"The bruises on his body really helped with the case against me.\n\n\n\n#kidnap #torture #reversed #beating #police #misunderstanding #planned #psycho","f":"i","l":["hor","lif"],"h":"https://www.yourquote.in/sherlock-doyle-9qp8/quotes/i-don-t-know-what-hit-me-one-day-i-woke-up-found-myself-day-bxp56m","p":"bxnu4j","n":"bxv8ga"}
