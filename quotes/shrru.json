But it did come and we're stranded at the sea. We're disoriented and thrown away from our course. We're away from our family and the wait only increased.\nAfter being away for months, we're finally able to return back to the port from where we'd sailed. We're happy to be back and to find the lighthouse glowing with a welcoming light, showing us our path. Our families have gathered near the shore to welcome us in the growing dusk.\n\nAs the light from the lighthouse began to flicker and fail, it became harder for us to make out the faces of our families. We strained our eyes to see our loved ones, whom we've not seen for so long.\nTheir eyes seemed strangely vacant, devoid of any emotions, as if they're not happy to see us. Their limbs seemed crookedly joined and they had a twisted smile.\n\nAs we're worried to see their faces, we're also worried about the lighthouse. Why would the light fail when it's so important for us? Then we noticed the pattern in the light.\nIt wasn't flickering, it was going on and off at a constant rate, a repeating pattern of dots and dashes, Morse Code.\n\n“GO BACK,” it said, “THEY'RE NOT YOUR FAMILIES ANYMORE.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCollab on this short story prompt & write a story titled blindness. #blindnessstory #blindness #YourQuoteAndMine\nCollaborating with YourQuote Baba\n\n\n\n\n\n#lighthouse #sailor #family #zombie #love ","f":"i","m":[[1333,1347]],"l":["hor","lov"],"h":"https://www.yourquote.in/sherlock-doyle-9qp8/quotes/when-returned-weren-t-welcomed-their-love-gone-blind-read-shrru","p":"sf71e","n":"si892"}
