On this day, sisters of all ages tie a talisman, or amulet, called the rakhi, around the wrists of their brothers, symbolically protecting them, receiving a gift in return, and traditionally investing the brothers with a share of the RESPONSIBILITY OF THEIR POTENTIAL CARE.\n\n\n\n\n\n#rakshabandhan #sister #brother #stalker #badthings #sisterlove\nThis tale can mean #murder, or #acidattack, or anything else.
