So I ran the code again.\n\nI'd created the Daerryl algorithm, a code to generate the digits of Pi. It could generate billions of digits in the blink of an eye. I wanted to know Pi to its entirety since it defines everything, from the atoms to the universe.\n\nBut it happened again, the impossible error. After running for a few days, the code started generating only zeros. There were so many 0s that the code couldn't see the end of it.\n\nI need to run the code again, I thought. And I did. Impossible! The 0s have moved.\nI should check the code, I thought. But I knew very well that the code was correct.\n\nA universal constant can't change, I kept thinking for the next few days as the code ran. This time the 0s have moved another hundred places closer. I ran the code again and the 0s have moved a thousand places.\n\nIt was getting closer, getting faster as time went. I felt the universe collapsing around me, the atoms collapsing inside me.\nThe 0s were heading for us, time seemed to speed up, but I felt slow. There were just zeros everywhere, null, void.\n\nI wanted to know the end of Pi. I didn't want to wake something up. And now the void is coming to grasp us.\n\n\n\n\n\n#code #constant #universe #atom #scifi #demons #end #infinite","f":"i","l":["hor","sto"],"h":"https://www.yourquote.in/sherlock-doyle-9qp8/quotes/end-pi-i-wanted-know-more-about-p-something-s-wrong-bbvam3","p":"bbo8l3","n":"bbz1v5"}
