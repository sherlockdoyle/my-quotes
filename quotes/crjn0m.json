Each story can be read on its own (but might not make any sense), but some things are better understood if you read the other stories too. Some stories are not in chronological order. To read the story, go to the stories tagged #fragments_by_sd, sort by oldest, and start from the beginning. Other stories with the same tag might get added later, so make sure you read the right one (mine). Enjoy!\n\nThe following is a behind-the-scenes look at the story, where I talk about the writing process and the ideas behind it. There may be spoilers, so it's better to read the story first.\n\nI started writing stories again on this platform after a while. Luckily, I joined when #YoStoWriMo was still ongoing, but most of it was already over. However, I decided to start writing from the first prompt, using the titles as inspiration. Initially, I only planned to write individual stories.\n\nWhen I saw the prompt for day 7 and the following days, I got the idea to write something bigger. The plan was to make each story as standalone as possible, but as I continued writing, it became harder to keep them independent yet connected. I did my best to make everything coherent, and I hope I succeeded.\n\nWhen I began writing this, I had a general idea of the overall story, but the individual stories were written as I went along. I even changed my ideas for the stories as I wrote them. I aimed to make everything make sense without any inconsistencies. My main challenge was to have each individual story somehow relate to the given title while being part of the whole. This sometimes required using transitional segments, and some stories may have felt slightly rushed.\n\nYou may notice that the initial stories were written in a more professional style, showcasing an expanded vocabulary. However, as the narrative progressed, I decided to adopt a more casual style. The idea was that as the main character delves into his past, particularly his childhood, the writing style would change to reflect that, becoming more childlike.\n\nBy the way, did you notice? The story is mostly written in first-person narrative, as if I am the main character. I use the pseudonym Sherlock Doyle for my online presence. The neighbor, an alter ego of (mine and) the main character, is Dr. Shelly Cooke. Their names are anagrams, symbolizing their shared identity all along.\n\nSome parts of the story mirror my own life, but they are very minor. And no, I don't have any criminal activities in my past. I don't have a neighbor who is a serial killer or an alter ego. Even if I did, I wouldn't know! That last sentence is a joke. My stories do not reflect who I am, but I do draw inspiration from my life and the people around me.
