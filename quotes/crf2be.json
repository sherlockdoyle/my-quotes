Despite the unsettling feeling it stirred within me, I couldn't resist the call of curiosity mingled with a hint of fear. After thoughtful contemplation, I resolved to set forth on a journey to this mysterious place that held countless unanswered questions.\n\n                                                          cont...","c":"As I ventured further on my path, the winding roads unfolded before me, carrying a peculiar sense of familiarity in the air. The surroundings appeared strangely recognizable, like a distant echo from the past, yet I struggled to pinpoint the exact source of this deja vu. Elusive memories danced at the edges of my consciousness, playing a teasing game of hide-and-seek. They were like fleeting shadows, offering mere glimpses of forgotten scenes that I desperately tried to piece together.\n\nAt long last, I arrived at the destination—a dilapidated, weather-beaten house that bore the scars of time. The relentless march of years had left indelible marks on the weary structure, transforming it into a testament of neglect and abandonment. An aura of mystery enveloped the place, as if hidden tales and untold secrets resided within its timeworn walls. A chill traveled down my spine, tingling with a mixture of unease and anticipation. The sight before me stirred a bittersweet emotion, akin to a melancholic melody that tugged at my heartstrings. It was as though the very essence of the house yearned to reveal its secrets, patiently awaiting a courageous soul to unravel its mysteries.\n\nThe old house stood resolute, symbolizing older days and bearing the marks of time's ceaseless passage. Its once grand and inviting windows now lay shattered and barricaded, shutting out the world beyond. The worn-out slabs beneath my feet were cracked and weathered, marked by countless footsteps that had traversed them. Nature, persistent as ever, had claimed parts of the house as its own, with vibrant green vines climbing the walls, as if nature sought to reclaim what rightfully belonged to her. The house wore its age with a certain pride, every crack and crevice narrating a tale of days long gone, memories etched within its very foundation. As I gazed upon it, a sense of wistfulness washed over me, as if the house itself held a repository of untold stories and hidden treasures, yearning to be uncovered.\n\nSummoning all the courage I could muster, I took a deep breath, steadying my nerves, and with resolute determination, I crossed the threshold into the unknown.\n\n\n\n#fragments_by_sd #journey #dejavu #enter\n\nWelcome to the day 20 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e. May. \n\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled #theoldhouse.
