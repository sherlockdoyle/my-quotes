The sky outside her window was painted orange and pink as the sun set, signaling the end of another day. She stood in front of the mirror, her reflection staring back at her with sad eyes. It's not that Arjun didn't love her, his devotion shone through every little thing he did for her. But Mahaira couldn't muster up even an ounce of affection towards him. Her heart belonged elsewhere. She packed a small bag, stealing glances at the picture of them on the nightstand as if seeking some kind of answer or justification. But all she found were empty words and unspoken regrets.\n\nArjun Dhanraj had first seen Mahaira while she was returning from college. It was a day like any other, but for Arjun, it was the day he fell in love. Her laughter echoed in his ears, her smile imprinted in his mind. It was love at first sight for him, a feeling so profound that it consumed him.\n\nWith his heart pounding in his chest, he had gone to her house with a marriage proposal. His palms were sweaty, his voice shaky, but his resolve was firm. He remembered the way her parents had looked at him, their eyes filled with surprise and curiosity. But as he spoke, his sincerity and love for Mahaira shone through. Her parents had agreed instantly, seeing the love and respect he had for their daughter.\n\nArjun lived only with his mother. His father had passed away when he was just a young boy, leaving behind a business empire that now rested on Arjun's young shoulders. The loss of his father was a wound that never truly healed, but it also served as a driving force for Arjun. He worked tirelessly, pouring his heart and soul into the business. His efforts bore fruit and now, his empire was even bigger than what his father had left him.\n\nMahaira's parents were overjoyed with this turn of events. Not only had they found a rich husband for their daughter, but he was also a man of character. Arjun had made it clear from the beginning that he wanted nothing more than their daughter's hand in marriage. The concept of dowry was alien to him. This gesture further endeared him to Mahaira's parents. They felt they couldn't have asked for a better match for their daughter.\n\nIt was the first night after their marriage. Mahaira sat on the flower-decorated bed, her heart heavy with unshed tears. The room was filled with the scent of roses and jasmine, a stark contrast to the turmoil in her heart. When Arjun entered, it was already past midnight. He looked at her, his eyes filled with a mix of concern and confusion.\n\nBefore he could utter a word, Mahaira broke the silence, her voice barely a whisper, “Arjun, I need you to understand something.”\n\nHe nodded, urging her to continue.\n\n“I... I can't be the wife you deserve. I love someone else.”\n\nArjun was taken aback, his heart aching at her confession. But he managed to keep his composure, his voice steady, “Mahaira, I respect your feelings. I won't touch you without your consent.”\n\nWith that, he moved to the other side of the bed, giving her the space she needed. He fell asleep quietly, his mind a whirlwind of thoughts and questions. The room was silent, save for the soft sobs of Mahaira and the steady rhythm of Arjun's breathing.\n\nDid Mahaira see a glimmer of tears in the corner of Arjun's eyes? She wasn't sure. What was it to her anyway? She had made her feelings clear. It didn't matter to her. She was lost in her own world of turmoil and guilt. His feelings, his pain, they didn't concern her. Or at least, that's what she told herself as she turned to her side, her back facing him. The weight of her confession still hung in the air, but for now, sleep claimed her, offering a temporary escape from the reality of her situation. As she drifted off to sleep, the room fell silent once again, the only sound being the soft rustling of the sheets and the distant hum of the city outside.\n\nMahaira remembered the day she had returned from college. It was an ordinary day, or so she had thought. She had walked into her house, her mind still buzzing with the day's lectures, only to be met with the news of her impending marriage. Her parents had sat her down, their faces serious, their words heavy with expectation.\n\nShe had denied outright, her voice firm, her eyes defiant. She had a boyfriend, she had said, her heart pounding in her chest. Eshan, she had said, was his name. He was a struggling painter, his life a canvas of dreams and aspirations. He wasn't rich, he didn't have a business empire, but he had something that no amount of money could buy - her love.\n\nThe reaction of her parents had been swift and harsh. Her mother had slapped her outright, the sound echoing in the silent room. They didn't approve of Eshan, the poor painter. His dreams and aspirations meant nothing to them. All they saw was a man who couldn't provide for their daughter, a man who didn't fit into the world of wealth and status.\n\nMahaira had cried that night, her tears a silent protest against the injustice of it all. She didn't eat anything, her heart too heavy with sorrow. In her desperation, she had turned to Eshan, her voice choked with tears as she asked him to elope with her. She had hoped, prayed, that he would agree, that they could leave everything behind and start a new life together. But Eshan had denied, his voice filled with regret. He had asked for time, time to prove himself. But time was a luxury they didn't have.\n\nA year had passed since Mahaira's marriage to Arjun. It was a year filled with silent dinners, polite conversations, and unspoken words. Arjun had kept his word, he never even touched her. He respected her space, her feelings, and her love for Eshan. He was a constant presence in her life, yet he was also a stranger, a man she was married to but didn't love.\n\nToday, finally, the day was here. Eshan had agreed to elope. He had called her late last night, his voice filled with a mix of excitement and fear. He asked her to meet him at the railway station, their ticket to a new life together. The thought of leaving everything behind was terrifying, yet it was also liberating. She was finally going to be with the man she loved.\n\nAs she packed her belongings, her heart pounded in her chest. She looked around the room, her eyes lingering on the bed she shared with Arjun, the man who had shown her nothing but respect and kindness. A pang of guilt washed over her, but she pushed it aside. This was her chance at happiness, and she wasn't going to let it slip away.\n\n\nTo be continued...\n\n\n\nAlthough this is an original idea, I feel like I've read a similar story somewhere. Who knows...\n\n\nBackground created with Dall-E.\n\n\n\n#loveatfirstsight #elope #choice #desperation #respect #forbiddenlove #complicated","f":"i","l":["sto","lov"],"h":"https://www.yourquote.in/sherlock-doyle-9qp8/quotes/art-deception-1-mahaira-preparing-leave-husband-today-sky-it-csu0cx","p":"cstp8c","n":"csvixn"}
