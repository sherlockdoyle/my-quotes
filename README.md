# My Quotes

Once upon a long, long time ago, I used to write stories on [YourQuote](https://www.yourquote.in/). This started when I took part in a story-writing competition hosted by Eclectica, the literature club of my college. Since then, I've written many things-although nowadays I'm more interested in writing code rather than stories. This repository and the website are a collection of all the quotes I've written over the years, a backup of sorts.

On a side note, I would request that you support YourQuote-they have been open with their problems. In a world filled with short videos, the culture of reading short stories has been lost. Maybe with your help, we can bring that back!
