The air inside was stale and heavy, carrying the weight of forgotten memories and untold stories. As I explored each room, I found traces of what used to be a magnificent home, now just a shell of its former self.\n\n                                                          cont...","c":"The old house seemed stuck in the past, with peeling walls and creaky floors. It was clear that this place had seen better days, maybe decades ago when it was full of laughter and life. But now, there was nothing valuable or familiar left, only the remains of forgotten dreams and faded reminders of the past.\n\nI climbed the creaky stairs, their noise echoing through the empty hallways. The rooms on the first floor tempted me, offering a glimpse into a forgotten history. As I reached the door, its worn handle protested with a squeak as I turned it. The door swung open with a gust of wind, revealing a room frozen in time.\n\nAs I stepped inside, the old door slammed shut behind me, startling me. A cloud of dust rose, swirling in the sunlight that came through a barred window. Surprised, I looked back and froze in place. A piece of the decaying ceiling had fallen, blocking the door. Panic flooded over me as I realized I was trapped, unable to leave the room or reach the rest of the house. I desperately tried to open the door, my hands shaking as I struggled with the stubborn handle, but it refused to budge.\n\nTired from my unsuccessful attempts to escape, I sat down on the dusty floor, feeling defeated. Leaning against the unyielding door, my mind raced as I tried to remember my connection to this house. Memories lingered on the edge of my thoughts, just out of reach, like a fading dream upon waking.\n\nI closed my eyes, embracing the darkness of the room, hoping to coax the elusive memories to resurface. But they remained frustratingly out of grasp, as if intentionally hidden, intensifying my sense of being trapped. It felt like I was not only confined within the room but also lost in the corridors of my own mind.\n\n\n\n#fragments_by_sd #crack #memories #decay\n\nWelcome to the day 21 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e. May. \n\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled #trapped.
