Though his official work involved cleaning and running errands, he practically lived at the school. That's where he and his wife Lakshmi resided, in a small, basic room on the premises. Despite their humble circumstances, they had a treasure - their son Vivek.\n\nVivek was always a bright spark. Even though they couldn't afford much, the school teachers, impressed by his talent, went above and beyond to help him. Thanks to their support, Vivek now worked at a big, fancy company far away in a bustling city. He had settled there, building a new life for himself.\n\nPoverty had never stopped Lakshmi from celebrating Vivek's birthday in a special way. Every year, on that day, she meticulously prepared a delicious kheer as an offering to the Gods. In her eyes, her son was a blessing, and she expressed her gratitude in this simple, heartfelt way.\n\nAfter Shankar's retirement, they had finally managed to build a small but sturdy house of their own. This had drained their savings, leaving them dependent on Vivek's monthly support.\n\n\nShankar returned home from the market with a small packet of jalebis. \"Lakshmi,\" he announced, \"this year, let's offer this to the Gods instead. Why the same kheer all the time, eh?\"\n\nLakshmi looked at the packet. She could tell Shankar had bought twenty rupees worth of jalebis. She realized that Vivek hadn't sent any money this month. Maybe he had forgotten, just like he had for the past seven months.\n\n\n\nBackground created with Dall-E.\n\n#family #sacrifice #education #poverty #tradition #resilience #aging #neglect","f":"i","l":["lif","lov"],"h":"https://www.yourquote.in/sherlock-doyle-9qp8/quotes/shankar-peon-government-high-school-familiar-face-everyone-s-cuga65","p":"cufyqr","n":"culynm"}
