{"d":"2023-10-07T08:49:56Z","t":"There are many intricate ways to love a person.\nYou can steal them away in the dead of night,\ncrossing seas and boundaries, igniting a war of many.\nTo do this properly, you require a city of gold,\na thousand ships, a face that launches them, and one\nheart that yearns for another.\n\n                                                                                   cont...\n\n","c":"Or you can meet in secret, under the cover of darkness,\nexchanging vows and promises, defying the stars themselves.\nBut for this, you need a moonlit balcony,\ntwo feuding houses, a friar with a plan, a vial of potion,\nand a love so deep it ends in tragedy.\n\nDispensing with secrecy, you may, if the heart allows,\nbuild a monument to them. But then you need\na river of tears, a mausoleum of marble,\nnot to mention skilled artisans, precious gemstones,\nmore marbles, a love story etched in stone, and\na symbol of love that stands the test of time.\n\nIn an age of steam and steel, you may find\nlove on a ship bound for destiny. All you then\nrequire is an iceberg in your path, two\nlives intertwined, a string quartet playing,\nseveral lifeboats short, a promise and\na love that even death can not part.\n\nThese are, as I began, intricate ways\nto love a person. Simpler, direct, and much more profound\nis to know that you love them in the depths of your heart,\neven though they remain untouched by your affection.\nAnd that's enough.\n\n\n\nThis was pretty much 'Five Ways to Kill a Man' by Edwin Brock.\n\n\nIf you are good with words, you might like this: https://sherlockdoyle.github.io/antonemo/ (link also available in profile)\n\n#unrequited #love #eternal #timeless #intricate #tragedy #destiny #poetry","f":"i","l":["pot","lov"],"h":"https://www.yourquote.in/sherlock-doyle-9qp8/quotes/there-many-intricate-ways-love-person-you-steal-them-away-do-csb0qn","p":"csbrmi","n":"cscbem"}
