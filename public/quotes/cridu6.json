{"d":"2023-06-26T01:56:27Z","t":"As I walked through the room, a feeling of nostalgia weighed heavily in the air. The old floorboards creaked with each step I took, and I looked around, hoping to find something from the past. Sunlight streamed through the windows, dust particles sparkled in the air, illuminating the forgotten objects in a sad way. Among the toys that were left behind, I noticed an old diary with yellowed pages.\n                                                          cont...","c":"Curiosity got the best of me, and I picked up the diary, feeling its weight and remembering a time when I used to be alone. Flipping through the pages, memories rushed back, taking me back to a time of innocence and curiosity. The diary had been a small gift from my dad on one of my earlier birthdays.\n\nAlthough my dad was always busy with work and responsibilities, and it often felt like he didn't have much time for me, this old diary with its faded pages and worn binding reminded me that deep down, beneath all the busyness, he did care about me, even if just a little. At that moment, I couldn't help but wish for his presence, for the warmth and security he used to provide.\n\nIt had been a few years since my dad passed away from natural causes. His absence left a huge void, and I often found myself longing for his guidance and love. Each day that went by, I realized that life is temporary, and everyone has to leave one day. My dad's departure was a clear reminder of this truth, a lesson that touched my heart.\n\nMy mother had been gone for a long time too, and her absence didn't bring any affection. Our relationship was strained and distant, and her own struggles took over her life until she became unrecognizable as the woman who gave birth to me. I had already mourned her loss long before she physically left.\n\nThinking about all this, I couldn't help but see the temporary nature of our lives. People come and go, leaving behind fragments of their presence. The fleeting moments we share with others become the threads that shape our lives. Even the girl I once admired, Jasmine from the park, had disappeared from my life, leaving a void in the place where we used to spend time among the blooming flowers.\n\n\n\n#fragments_by_sd #memories #loss #unloved\n\nWelcome to the day 28 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e. May. \n\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled #temporarymatter.
