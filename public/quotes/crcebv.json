{"d":"2023-06-06T07:06:53Z","t":"The park had become an essential part of my daily routine, dull as it might be. Every day, like clockwork, I found comfort in its peaceful embrace, seeking escape from the chaos of my ordinary life. The moment I set foot in the park, a wave of comfort washed over me as I immersed myself in the breathtaking beauty of nature. Surrounded by vibrant blooms and breathing in the sweet, fragrant air, I discovered a sense of peace that I couldn't find elsewhere.\n\n                                                                 cont...","c":"Amidst this scenic setting, there was one person who caught my attention and captivated my heart—a girl with long, flowing hair that seemed to dance in harmony with the gentle breeze. With each graceful movement, she brought an aura of elegance and charm to the park. Regardless of the weather, rain or shine, I could always find her near the blossoming flowers, completely engrossed in her own world. She seemed to exist in a realm of her own creation, far away from the worries and troubles of the outside world. Her choice of attire, a delicately hugging sundress, only enhanced the graceful vision she presented.\n\nHer obsession with flowers was evident in all her actions. She would sit among the blossoms, sketching their delicate petals in a worn-out notebook, her nimble fingers capturing every intricate detail. It was clear she cherished a deep fascination and connection with the park's blooming beauties. I often wondered what drew her to these plants and what secrets she believed they held. She would also take notes, carefully writting down observations and thoughts as if translating the language of nature itself.\n\nDespite my curiosity, attempts to strike up a conversation with her had proven fruitless. She seemed to exist in a world of her own, responding with short, polite answers. Jasmine, she said her name was. It was as if she communicated better with flowers than with people. Undeterred, I persisted, determined to uncover the layers of mystery that surrounded her. I found solace in her presence. She became a silent companion, a figure that added a touch of enchantment to my daily visits to the park.\n\nOne day, as I made my way to our usual meeting spot, I realized something was wrong. The girl was nowhere to be seen. Concern tugged at my heart as I asked other regular park-goers about her sudden absence, hoping someone had caught a glimpse of her. To my dismay, everyone claimed they had not seen her for an entire week. Panic mingled with the fragrance of the flowers, casting a shadow over the once tranquil park.\n\n\n\n#fragments_by_sd #obsession #love #missing\n\nWelcome to the day 8 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e. May. \n\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled #thegirlwholovedflowers.
