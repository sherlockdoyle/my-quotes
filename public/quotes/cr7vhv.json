Or maybe just a loss of will to live. All I know is that she stopped breathing one night. And the next morning, she began speaking.\n\nI thought it was a miracle at first, a sign that she was still alive somehow, that we had a chance to survive. But then I realized that she had changed. She was no longer the person I knew and loved. She was something else. Something evil.","c":"She told me about the horrors that awaited me, how the creatures that were hunting me down could sense my fear and hear my heartbeat, how they would rip me to pieces and devour my flesh, then turn me into one of them. She announced that there was no escape, that the whole world was infested by them, and that there was no place to hide or run. There was no hope for anyone, not even for me.\n\nShe repeated these things endlessly, day and night, without pause or mercy. She wouldn’t let me sleep or rest or think. She wouldn’t let me grieve or mourn or pray.\n\nShe just kept talking. And I just kept listening. Because I had no choice. Because I had nowhere to go.\n\nThey say that dead men tell no tales.\nBut dead women do. And they are the worst kind of tales.\n\n\n\nImage made with Dall-E.\n\n#horror #loss #survival #infection #fear #hopelessness #isolation #desperation","f":"i","l":["hor","lif"],"h":"https://www.yourquote.in/sherlock-doyle-9qp8/quotes/she-my-last-hope-she-didnt-make-it-i-dont-know-what-caused-i-cr7vhv","p":"cr6w7q","n":"cr75b1"}
