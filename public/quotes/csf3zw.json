{"d":"2023-10-23T07:40:06Z","t":"Irene sat in her cozy living room, engrossed in her book. The room was bathed in the soft glow of her reading lamp, and the only sound was the occasional turning of a page. But then, her phone rang, shattering the serene atmosphere. She frowned, not recognizing the number on the caller ID. She answered, cautiously, “Hello?”\n\nA worried voice on the other end, tinged with urgency, immediately asked, “Are you okay?”\n\nSurprised by the caller's tone, Irene replied, “I'm perfectly fine. Who is this?”","c":"The voice hesitated for a moment and then continued, “Thank goodness! I was just talking to you, and the call got disconnected suddenly. I was so worried about you.”\n\nIrene furrowed her brow, now thoroughly puzzled. The voice sounded very familiar. “I think you may have the wrong number. I haven't been on a call with anyone, and I'm definitely not in any trouble. You've got the wrong person.”\n\nThe person on the other end, however, didn't seem to hear her. She was breathing heavily and spoke with growing fear. “No, it can't be the wrong number. I was talking to you, and then I heard a scream and the call got disconnected. You have to believe me, Irene.”\n\nIrene tried to calm the caller down. “Okay, okay, just take a deep breath and tell me your name. How do you know me? What did you hear?”\n\nThe line was silent for a moment, but then the person responded, filled with fear and concern. “Irene, please, you need to listen to me. Something terrible is happening. I don't know how to explain it, but you have to believe me!”\n\nIrene glanced at her phone's screen, still displaying the unknown number. She sighed and tried to calm the person down. “I understand you're scared, but I promise you, you must have dialed the wrong number. I have no idea what you're talking about.”\n\nThe caller was frantic. “No, it was definitely your voice, Irene. You need to remember what we were talking about. It's essential!”\n\nIrene shook her head, her patience wearing thin. “I'm sorry, but I can't help you. Goodbye.”\n\nBut before she could hang up, the voice on the other end grew even more desperate. “Irene, please, listen to me!”\n\nJust as Irene was about to end the call, she heard a bone-chilling scream that sent shivers down her spine. The call abruptly disconnected.\n\nAlarmed and shaken, Irene immediately redialed the number. She could feel her heart racing as she heard the phone ring.\n\nThere was a brief silence, then a calm voice answered, “Hello?” The voice sounded familiar.\n\nIrene felt a surge of relief and fear at the same time. She asked, urgently, “Are you okay?”\n\nThe other person sounded surprised and confused. She replied, “I'm perfectly fine. Who is this?”\n\n\n\n#continuity_by_sd\n\nWelcome to the Day 8 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e, October.\n#mystery #identity #loop\nToday, write a #shortstory titled Wrong Number.
