Sweat drips down my face as I put all my determination into the task. Finally, with a loud crack, the plank breaks, revealing a small opening.\n\n                                                          cont...","c":"I feel excited as a glimmer of freedom shines through the broken barrier. The outside world calls out to me, promising freedom and a sense of belonging. But there's still more work to do.\n\nI carefully widen the gap, making enough space for me to squeeze through. The sharp edges of the broken wood scrape my skin, leaving scratches, but I hardly notice the pain. Escape is so close, and I can't let anything stop me.\n\nWith one last burst of strength, I push myself through the opening and come out on the other side. Relief washes over me, and my heart races. I'm standing on a tiled roof, feeling the cool surface under my feet. From up here, I can see an overgrown lawn that stretches out in front of me, with wild grass and weeds.\n\nThe air smells like earth and freedom, a big difference compared to the stale room I just left. The gentle breeze plays with my hair, as if celebrating my newfound freedom. I take a deep breath, enjoying the fresh air of the outside world.\n\nAs I stand there, memories come rushing back. 23 years ago, I stood on a different roof, my school's rooftop, looking down at the hard, unforgiving concrete below. The mean girls had cornered me, their insults and laughter echoed in my ears. That moment had left a deep mark on me, shaping me into the person I am today.\n\nI walk across the tiled roof, being careful on the uneven surface. The wind whispers through the trees, as if encouraging me and guiding me to my next destination. I notice another window, one that doesn't have bars, giving me a way into another room.\n\nI approach the window cautiously, the dim light from inside creates spooky shadows on the floor. I peek inside, my heart pounding. The room is filled with old furniture and memories that seem frozen in time. It feels strangely familiar, like I've been here before, but I just can't put my finger on it.\n\n\n\n#fragments_by_sd #rooftop #freedom #escape\n\nWelcome to the day 24 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e. May. \n\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled #cornered.
