A world that had been torn asunder by the ravages of a nuclear war, leaving behind a desolate landscape devoid of trees, clean air, and hope. The air was thick with pollutants, and the only lifeline for the people was a machine supplied by OxyCorp that provided them with the precious oxygen they needed to survive.\n                                                          cont...","c":"Prya had always dreamed of seeing a tree. She had seen pictures of them in old books and movies, but they were nothing like the real thing. Trees were green and alive, they gave shade and fruit, they breathed out oxygen and absorbed carbon dioxide. They were the opposite of the machines that Prya and everyone else depended on for survival.\n\nThe machines were gray and cold. OxyCorp claimed that they were the only ones who could provide oxygen for the remaining humans, and they charged a hefty price for it. Anyone who couldn't afford it was left to suffocate in the polluted air.\n\nAs Prya traversed the barren wasteland, the rusty ruins of the old world loomed like silent ghosts. Prya hated the corporation and their machines. She hated living in a cramped and dirty city, where everyone was either sick or scared. She hated being a slave to a system that cared nothing for her or anyone else. She wanted to escape, to find a better way of living, to breathe free.\n\nThat's why she decided to join the rebels, a group of people who dared to challenge OxyCorp and their monopoly on oxygen. The rebels had a secret plan, a rumor passed down from one generation to the next. Somewhere in the wasteland, far away from the city and OxyCorp's reach, there was a tree. A real tree, a living tree, the last tree on Earth. And not just any tree, but a special tree that had survived the nuclear war and had adapted to the harsh conditions. A tree that could grow new trees from its seeds, and restore the balance of nature.\n\nThe rebels believed that if they could find this tree and bring back a sample of it, they could start a revolution. They could plant new trees and create new sources of oxygen. They could free themselves from OxyCorp and their machines. They could heal the world and make it green again.\n\nPrya volunteered to be part of the expedition that would search for the tree. She knew it wasn't a simple journey to find this legendary tree. Many had tried and failed. OxyCorp, which held a tight grip on the oxygen machines, saw the tree as a threat to its power and did everything in its might to thwart those who ventured out in search of it. The path was treacherous, filled with unseen dangers, and none who had embarked on this quest had ever returned. But she was willing to take the risk, for she had nothing to lose and everything to gain.\n\nThey traveled by night, avoiding the patrols of OxyCorp's drones and soldiers. But the night was not their friend, for it brought new horrors and challenges. Dust storms raged in the darkness, blinding them and choking them with sand. Mutated creatures lurked in the shadows, their bodies twisted by the nuclear fallout. Other nomad factions had attacked them and robbed them of their supplies, their humanity eroded by the harsh conditions. Prya had seen her companions fall one by one, to bullets, claws, or blades. She had fought, she had run, she had survived. But she was alone now, the last of her kind. The only one who still had a hope to save the world.\n\nTime passed slowly for Prya, as she journeyed across the barren land. Her determination was her only companion. And then, after many days of traveling, as she crossed a desolate plain, she saw it. A valley hidden by a wall of rocks. The lone tree stood before her, in the center of the valley, a beacon of hope in a world of despair. Its gnarled branches reached for the sky, the leaves a vibrant green that contrasted with the desolation that surrounded it.\n\nPrya approached the tree with reverence, marveling at the miracle of its existence. She carefully collected a sample of its leaves, her heart filled with the anticipation of returning to her people and restoring life to their world.\n\nBut her elation was short-lived. As Prya stepped back from the tree, the ground beneath her trembled. A deep, guttural growl echoed through the air, sending shivers down her spine. She turned, only to find the tree coming to life in a horrifying and unimaginable way. It was not a savior; it was a predator.\n\nShe had found the last tree, but it was no benevolent survivor. It was a monstrous mutation, a cruel twist of fate. A hybrid creature that had evolved from both kingdoms after the nuclear war. A creature that had learned to survive by feeding on both sunlight and flesh.\n\nThe tree's branches twisted and contorted, revealing grotesque, gnashing mouths filled with razor-sharp teeth. Its roots erupted from the ground, snaking their way towards her like sinister serpents. Prya's horror turned to paralyzing fear as the tree ensnared her and pulled her closer to its carnivorous maw. With a sickening bite, it severed Prya's head from her body.\n\n\n\n#continuity_by_sd\n\nWelcome to the Day 11 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e, October.\n#apocalypse #hope #scifi\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled The Lonely Tree.
