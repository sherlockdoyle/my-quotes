{"d":"2023-11-08T08:20:37Z","t":"Kevin felt a pang of loneliness as he watched his friend Charles texting on his phone. They were sitting in a restaurant, having a casual dinner. The soft murmur of other diners and the clinking of cutlery filled the air. But Kevin had hoped for something more. It was his birthday, after all. Did Charles even remember?\n\n                                                          cont...","c":"They had met in a bar, when Kevin was going through a messy divorce. He was drowning his sorrows in alcohol, and Charles, a compassionate stranger, was the only one who offered him a shoulder to cry on, and they struck up a conversation. It was during that conversation that they discovered they both carried the heavy burden of heartbreak. Charles, a talented photographer, had been called to photograph a wedding anniversary that fateful day. To his surprise, it turned out to be his ex-girlfriend's celebration.\n\nThey had both found solace in their shared heartache, and their unlikely friendship blossomed. Charles was like a brother to Kevin, the only person he could trust and rely on. He had lost touch with most of his old friends, who had sided with his ex-wife or simply drifted away.\n\nKevin sighed and tried to make conversation. “So, how's work going?”\n\nCharles looked up from his phone and smiled. “It's going great, man. I have a lot of projects lined up. In fact, I have to deliver some pictures right after this. Do you mind coming with me? It won't take long.”\n\nKevin felt a surge of anger. How could Charles be so insensitive? He was using his birthday as an excuse to do business. He wanted to say no, but he didn't want to ruin the evening. He nodded reluctantly. “Sure, I guess.”\n\nThey finished their meal and left the restaurant. Kevin walked beside Charles, feeling miserable. He remembered how his wife used to surprise him with cakes and gifts on his birthday. He missed her, even though they were divorced.\n\nThey reached a house in a quiet neighborhood. Charles turned to Kevin and said, “This is the place. Come on, let's go.” He rang the doorbell and waited for someone to open the door.\n\nKevin had followed him, wondering who lived there. The door opened, and Kevin's eyes widened. He heard a loud chorus of “Surprise!” and saw his old friends standing in the living room, holding balloons and banners. He recognized some of his former colleagues, his college buddies, his childhood friends. A birthday cake sat on the table, candles flickering in the dim light. He was speechless.\n\nCharles grinned and hugged him. “Happy Birthday, Kevin,” he said, clapping him on the shoulder. “Did you really think I'd forget?”\n\nKevin was overcome with emotion. He realized that Charles had planned this all along. He had been busy on his phone, but not with work - he had been coordinating and planning the entire surprise party. He had been texting and calling his old friends, inviting them to the party. He had not forgotten his birthday, he had made it special.\n\n\n\n#continuity_by_sd\n\nWelcome to the Day 19 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e, October.\n#surprise #birthday #reunion\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled Close Friends.
