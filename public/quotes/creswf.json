Gray clouds hung low in the sky, matching the heavy hearts of those present. It was a small affair, attended by only a handful of people who had known Jasmine, the flower girl from the park. She seemed to have left a mark on only a select few.\n\n                                                          cont...","c":"Hidden amidst the shadowed trees, I stood at a distance, watching the proceedings unfold. I wasn't invited to the funeral, nor did I expect to be. Our connection had been one of silent admiration, fleeting glances, and stolen moments in the park. Words were never exchanged beyond the occasional polite response, yet my heart overflowed with the unsaid things that now echoed within me.\n\nAs the eulogy began, memories of our encounters flooded my mind. Jasmine's life was a reflection of her name—pure and delicate, like the blossoms she loved so dearly. I recalled the delicate brush of her hand as she plucked a flower from the ground, the way her eyes sparkled with joy at the sight of a blooming rose, and her graceful movements among the blossoms, as if she were part of their exquisite dance. The depth of my unspoken feelings became painfully apparent, and regret washed over me like a crashing wave.\n\nShe had brought color and beauty into my life, an escape from the monotony that surrounded me. In her presence, the park came alive, its beauty amplified by her very existence. Yet, I had always hesitated, held back by my own insecurities and the fear of rejection. I had allowed opportunities to pass, assuming there would always be more time.\n\nNow, it was too late. The flower girl was gone, forever out of reach. Her departure had left a void, not only in the park but also within my own heart. I yearned to express the admiration and affection that had remained hidden behind a veil of silence. But the chance had slipped away, lost in the currents of time. Her ghost had visited me, seen a friend in me, revealing the tragic fate that had befallen her. She was right, she was dead, but what could I have done?\n\nAs the ceremony drew to a close and the attendees began to disperse, I lingered a while longer, gazing at the freshly covered grave. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of nearby trees, as if nature itself mourned the loss. Tears welled up in my eyes, threatening to spill over, as I realized that I would never have the chance to say goodbye, to tell Jasmine how much she had meant to me.\n\nQuietly, I reached into my pocket and pulled out a single purple lavender, a symbol of purity and love. With a heavy heart, I whispered my farewell to the wind, hoping that somehow, in the realm beyond, Jasmine would hear my words.\n\n\n\n#fragments_by_sd #funeral #regret #loss\n\nWelcome to the day 16 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e. May. \n\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled #unsaidgoodbye.
