There wasn't any name on the sign.\nThe town was small but strange, the people were strange. They all looked at us with blank expressions in their eyes, all of their head tilted at a certain angle, as if trying to hear some distant sound.\n\nThen, for a moment, I heard it too. A low pitched humming, whose source I couldn't correctly locate.\nAnd, for a moment, the people in the car seemed strangers. I couldn't remember who we were, or where we were going. I just had my foot pressed on the accelerator.\n\nBut as we passed the last house of the town, as we went further away from the town, it all came back.\nWe were old friends traveling together. And now we were safe.\nAll five of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n#ghosttown #sign #welcome #silence #hallucination #zombie #mindcontrol #twist\n\n\n\n\n\nHEY! HEY! Did you see the twist?
