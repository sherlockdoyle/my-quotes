{"d":"2023-11-06T06:42:29Z","t":"As Mohan diligently cleaned his small, humble house for the upcoming Diwali festival, he stumbled upon a dusty package hidden away in a forgotten corner of the room. The name on the package caught his attention - it was from Dhruv, a name he hadn't heard in years. A pang of nostalgia washed over him as he recalled the days of his childhood, his friendship with Dhruv, and the dreams they once shared.","c":"Mohan and Dhruv had been inseparable during their early years. Both came from humble backgrounds, living in the same town, and attending the same government school. Their bond was forged in the crucible of poverty, and they shared dreams of a brighter future. Dhruv was an honest but shrewd young boy, always looking for opportunities to make a little extra money. He was determined to break free from the shackles of poverty and achieve something more.\n\nOne day, under the shade of an old banyan tree in the town park, Dhruv had made a promise to Mohan, “No matter where life takes us, we'll always be together, Mohan. We'll share our successes and failures, and we'll make our families proud.”\n\nYears passed, and life unfolded as it does for most people. Dhruv, driven by his ambitions, had left their small town to seek his fortune in the bustling city. He worked hard, climbed the ladder of success, and indeed became a significant figure in the corporate world. He had become the person he once aspired to be. But as time went by, Mohan began to believe that Dhruv had forgotten his promise, left their friendship behind, and moved on with his life. \n\nA year back, Mohan had received a mysterious package from Dhruv. Fueled by bitterness and disappointment, he didn't open it. The package sat untouched in a corner of his house, serving as a silent reminder of broken promises and the lost innocence of their childhood. He had convinced himself that he didn't need him, that he didn't care.\n\nBut now, as Mohan held the dusty package in his hands, curiosity got the better of him. He decided it was time to uncover its contents. Carefully, he unwrapped it, and inside, he discovered a lottery ticket and a letter. The handwriting on the letter was unmistakably Dhruv's.\n\nMohan's heart skipped a beat as he read Dhruv's words.\n\n“Dear Mohan,\n\nI hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. It has been far too long since we last spoke or met. I want you to know that the bond we shared during our childhood has always held a special place in my heart.\n\nLife has taken us on different paths, and I've been fortunate to find some success in the city. But I've never forgotten our dreams, our friendship, and the promise we made under the old banyan tree. I want you to share in the blessings that life has bestowed upon me.\n\nRecently, I won a lottery, and I've sent you the winning ticket. It's a substantial sum of money, Mohan, and I hope it can be the start of a brighter future for you and your family. The ticket expires in three months, so please make sure to claim the prize within that time. I want you to use this money to improve your life and fulfill your own dreams.\n\nI deeply regret any misunderstandings that may have come between us, and I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me. We may have grown apart, but our bond remains unbroken, and I consider you my lifelong friend.\n\nWith the warmest regards and the deepest of friendships,\nDhruv”\n\nTears welled up in Mohan's eyes as he read Dhruv's letter, realizing the extent of his own bitterness and resentment. He couldn't believe that Dhruv had not only remembered him but had also wanted to help him find a better life. He looked at the lottery ticket, then at the letter, then at the date. It was November 6th, 2023. The ticket had expired on December, 2022. He had missed the deadline by a year.\n\nAs the lights of Diwali adorned the town in a warm, golden glow, Mohan sat alone, holding the ticket in his hand, lost in a whirlpool of emotions. The realization hit him hard, but it also brought a bitter-sweet smile on his face. Dhruv hadn't forgotten him after all. And sometimes, the most valuable gifts were the ones that didn't come wrapped in fancy packages.\n\n\n\n#continuity_by_sd\n\nWelcome to the Day 17 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e, October.\n#friendship #regret #forgiveness\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled The Package.
