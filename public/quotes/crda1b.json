{"d":"2023-06-09T06:39:33Z","t":"As the morning sunlight streamed through my bedroom window, I struggled to shake off the remains of a haunting dream. The vivid images remained in my mind, blurring the line between reality and the ethereal realm. Confusion clouded my thoughts, leaving me unsure of what was true and what was a figment of my imagination. Yet, one thing persisted—a faint scent of lavender that wafted through the air, invading my senses.\n\n                                                                 cont...","c":"Unable to ignore the persistent fragrance, I decided to take action. With trembling hands, I dialed the police, eager to share the information bestowed upon me by the ghostly apparition of the missing girl.\n\n“Please, you have to listen to me. The missing girl's ghost... she came to me last night,” I pleaded, relaying the details of our encounter. The officer on the other end of the line remained skeptical, dismissing my claims as the ramblings of an overactive imagination.\n\n“But I saw her! The missing girl's ghost appeared before me, pleading for justice. She told me she had been murdered,” I insisted, desperation creeping into my voice. The police officer let out a dismissive sigh. “Look, sir, we appreciate your concern, but we're dealing with a missing person's case here. We can't go chasing after ghosts.”\n\nFrustration welled up within me. How could they dismiss such a crucial piece of information so easily? “Wait,” I added, my voice determined. “You don't understand. The suspect, my neighbor, she's involved. I'm sure of it! What if she had run away? Perhaps she was involved in the girl's disappearance and subsequent murder.”\n\nThere was a pause on the other end of the line, and when the officer spoke again, his tone carried a hint of surprise. “You mean the neighbor girl? We've been trying to locate her too. Witnesses have reported seeing the two of them together on multiple occasions, engaging in conversations. They may have been more than just acquaintances. It's possible they were a couple.”\n\nMy heart skipped a beat at the revelation. I couldn't fathom the thought of the missing girl being involved with another girl. A surge of emotions, a mixture of jealousy and anger, flooded my veins. The news of their potential relationship stung, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nAs the police assured me that they were actively searching for the neighbor, my anxiety grew. Their words triggered a primal instinct within me, a sense of urgency to protect the one I held close to my heart. I did not know why.\n\n\n\n#fragments_by_sd #investigation #couple #enraged\n\nWelcome to the day 11 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e. May. \n\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled #thesecret.
