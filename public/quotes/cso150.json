{"d":"2023-11-28T12:41:27Z","t":"Mr. Usman stood in the dimly lit room, the suitcase open before him. The trolley, his faithful companion in the transient journey of his life, stared back at him. It was time to move again, and the act of packing was as familiar to him as the changing landscapes he had witnessed over the years. He folded the clothes neatly, tucked in a few cherished utensils, and secured his chef's knives in a special compartment, ensuring everything was in order. Moving was a skill he had mastered; it was the baggage that weighed heavily on his shoulders.","c":"As he zipped up the trolley, he reflected on the simplicity of his existence. A chef's life didn't demand much in terms of possessions. One bag sufficed, and the rest, he believed, could be acquired at any local market. However, bidding farewell to neighbors, a ritual he loathed during each relocation, lingered in his thoughts. His nomadic lifestyle meant that he never formed strong attachments to places or people.\n\nHis independence was his cherished possession. Mr. Usman saw himself as the master of his destiny, neither adhering to anyone's wishes nor forcing his own upon others. His culinary experiments mirrored his nomadic lifestyle. His love for experimenting in the kitchen had led him to become a chef, but the allure of a new place always trumped any attachments he might form.\n\nThe number of bags had increased when he got married. A few years later, his daughter Yasmin was born, adding another layer to his transient existence. Despite the establishment of a proper family, the act of moving remained the most difficult part for Mr. Usman, laden with bags and emotional farewells.\n\nIn Yasmin's late twenties, tragedy struck. She disappeared in an incident that left the police helpless. His wife's tears flowed for days, and even Mr. Usman, stoic as he was, couldn't escape the pall of sadness. Yet, a part of him, buried deep within, felt an odd sense of relief-the next move would be lighter. Eventually, his wife passed away of old age, and Mr. Usman found himself with even less to carry around.\n\nIn the early morning light, Mr. Usman left his now-empty apartment for the train station, avoiding any chance encounters with neighbors that might lead to goodbyes. Uncertain of his destination, he simply sat at the station and drifted into a deep sleep.\n\nThe shrill horn of a departing train jolted him awake. In a hurry, he ran and boarded the train. He didn't get a ticket as he didn't have a planned destination. As the train rumbled forward, Mr. Usman realized he had left his bag at the station. Surprisingly, he felt no worry. Without baggage, he felt a newfound sense of freedom. Seating himself near the door, he observed the passing landscape.\n\nIn the late hours of the night, as the train hurtled forward, Mr. Usman decided to visit the washroom. On his way, he was drawn to the door. The cold night air greeted him, and he held onto the handles, leaning out into the darkness.\n\nThe sensation was liberating. The wind whispered promises of freedom as Mr. Usman contemplated the weightlessness he felt, as if he could float away. The idea crossed his mind - to let go of the handle and fly away into the unknown. He wondered if, just this once, he should say his silent goodbyes to a lifetime of constant movement and soar into the vastness of the night.\n\n\n\n#continuity_by_sd\n\nWelcome to the Day 29 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e, October.\n#movement #baggage #suicide\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled The Last Goodbye.
