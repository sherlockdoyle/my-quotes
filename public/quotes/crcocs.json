For a moment, my mind raced with thoughts of danger and intruders. It took a moment for my sleepy mind to register the source of the noise. “FBI, open up,” I imagined the booming voice, but quickly dismissed it as my overactive imagination. However, the realization struck me that it was indeed the police at my door. My heart raced, and a knot formed in the pit of my stomach. What could they possibly want with me?\n                                                                 cont...","c":"I hurriedly made my way to the door, trying to compose myself before facing the officers. As I swung open the door, their stern expressions greeted me, heightening the seriousness of the situation. Their badges gleamed in the dim light, leaving no room for doubt about their authority. The air suddenly felt heavy with suspicion, my heart pounding in my chest as I tried to comprehend the reason for their unexpected visit.\n\n“We're here regarding the missing girl,” one of the officers stated, cutting straight to the point. My mind instantly flashed to the girl I had seen at the park, finding solace in her gentle presence. Somehow, I had become the person she talked to the most, and now, her disappearance had drawn the attention of law enforcement.\n\n“I... I've seen her,” I stammered, my voice betraying my nervousness. “But I don't know where she is. I just talked to her at the park.”\n\nThe officers exchanged a knowing glance, their eyes revealing a suspicion I couldn't ignore. “We have reports that she was seen with your neighbor,” one of them continued, their gaze now fixed upon me. “And witnesses claim they saw you frequenting your neighbor's house.”\n\nMy mind raced, trying to piece together the fragments of information. I did visit my neighbor's house, the mysterious loner who had moved in next door, but it was only to take care of her cat, as she had requested. The pieces of the puzzle began to fit together, forming a grim picture. It seemed that the police suspected foul play, and the neighbor had come under scrutiny as a potential suspect. But could my innocent actions have been misunderstood? Fear began to mix with confusion, creating a tangled web of emotions.\n\n“I swear, I only went there to take care of her cat,” I pleaded, desperation creeping into my voice. “I didn't know anything about the girl's disappearance.” I had accepted the responsibility out of a sense of neighborly goodwill, unaware of the disturbing events that had happened nearby. I explained how the neighbor had entrusted me with the task, leaving a note under my door.\n\nThe officers exchanged another glance, deliberating their next move. I noticed the flicker of doubt in their eyes, as if they were considering the possibility that I might be telling the truth.\n\n“Alright, for now, we will continue our investigation,” the officer finally declared, his voice tinged with a hint of caution. “But don't leave town, and make yourself available if we need to question you further.” Promising my full compliance, I closed the door and leaned against it, thinking about the sinister possibility that lurked next door.\n\nThe departure of the police left me with a mix of relief and unease, and the accusations lingered in my mind, haunting my thoughts. Was it possible that my neighbor, the very person I had believed to be harmless, could be involved in the girl's disappearance? The unsettling truth began to settle in, painting a darker picture of the person next door.\n\n\n\n#fragments_by_sd #missing #foulplay #suspicion\n\nWelcome to the day 9 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e. May. \n\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled #thekillernextdoor.
