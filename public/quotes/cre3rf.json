{"d":"2023-06-15T07:40:45Z","t":"Once again, I find myself alone in the stillness of my dimly lit room, burdened by the weight of solitude. The outside world feels like a distant memory, and the park, once a place of comfort, now serves as a haunting reminder of the girl I once knew. Her absence has cast a shadow, enveloping me in a cloak of misery. Days pass by in isolation, and I rarely muster the courage to step beyond the confines of my home. The walls seem to close in on me, echoing the emptiness that pervades my existence.\n                                                                 cont...","c":"Amidst this overwhelming loneliness, there remains one companion who shares my solitude—the cat that once belonged to my mysterious neighbor. After the police sealed her house, I took the feline in, offering it a new home within the boundaries of my own isolation. Together, we exist in silence, understanding each other's loss. The cat's presence brings a flicker of comfort to an otherwise silent existence.\n\nYet, as the days go by, my curiosity grows stronger, tempting me to explore the hidden diary I stumbled upon amidst the scattered notes and photographs. With a surge of newfound courage, I open its worn pages, delving into the memories and musings inscribed within. Flipping through its aged and weathered sheets, I notice something unsettling—a revelation that sends shivers down my spine. Among the familiar entries, there, at the very end, is new writing scribbled on the page. I was certain it hadn't been there before.\n\nThe words stare back at me, instilling fear that grips my heart like a tightening vine. It's a chilling warning, indicating that the neighbor, the enigmatic figure who vanished without a trace, is now coming for me. Questions swarm my mind, demanding answers. What have I unwillingly stumbled upon? What secrets had I stumbled upon? And, most importantly, how can I protect myself from the impending and unknown threat that draws nearer with every passing moment?\n\n\n\n#fragments_by_sd #loneliness #courage #warning\n\nWelcome to the day 17 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e. May. \n\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled #aftertheend.
