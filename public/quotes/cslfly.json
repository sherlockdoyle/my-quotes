{"d":"2023-11-13T12:57:48Z","t":"The room was abuzz with excitement as people eagerly lined up for Zarif's book signing event. Zarif had just published his best-seller, a collection of poems that depicted the intricate tapestry of his life-filled with hardships, friendships, and his own personal journey from the streets to stars. He remembered the days when he had nothing but his words and his dreams, and the people who had helped him along the way.","c":"As Zarif sat behind the table, pen in hand, ready to sign copies of his book, he couldn't help but reflect on the turning points of his life. He owed his education and growth to the well-wishers he had encountered and an NGO-run study center. Among them, he had met Mohan, who would eventually introduce him to Neha.\n\nNeha, unlike Zarif, came from a wealthy background. However, she had a genuine curiosity about life and a compassionate heart that drew her to spend time with Zarif and Mohan. Zarif admired her for that, and over time, a special connection had formed between them. They shared stories, dreams, and, most importantly, a love for literature. Amidst the pages of books and the scribbles of poetry, their friendship blossomed into something more for Zarif.\n\nHowever, life had other plans, and Neha had to move to another city, leading to the inevitable loss of contact between them. Before parting ways, Zarif had given her a notebook containing his heartfelt poems-a piece of himself that he hoped would keep their connection alive. She had hugged him and thanked him, and promised to keep in touch. But they never did.\n\nToday, as Zarif sat at a table in the bookstore, signing book after book for a long queue of people, a sense of nostalgia lingered in the air. He was smiling and chatting, but his mind was elsewhere. When a familiar, worn-out notebook was placed before him, he mindlessly took the pen to sign, immersed in the rhythm of the moment. It was only halfway through the signature that he realized he wasn't signing his new book. He recognized his handwriting, his poems.\n\nSurprised, he looked up, and there she was-a familiar face, maybe a bit older, but still beautiful, smiling at him. She stood before him, holding the notebook that had traveled through the years, a tangible link to their past.\n\n“Hi, Zarif. I'm sorry I'm late,” she exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with recognition and joy.\n\n\n\nInspired by Hello!/Taqdeer by Vikram Kumar.\n\n\n#continuity_by_sd\n\nWelcome to the Day 22 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e, October.\n#reunion #friendship #success\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled A Love Story With Books.
