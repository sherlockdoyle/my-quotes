From my window, I watched her cautiously unload a few boxes from the moving truck. She had short, jet-black hair and a quiet demeanor that seemed to exude an air of mystery. It was apparent that she preferred her solitude, never engaging in conversation with anyone in the neighborhood. She rarely ventured outside, and when she did, her eyes were always cast downward, avoiding any form of interaction with the residents around her.\n                                                                 cont...","c":"Days turned into weeks, and yet, the mysterious neighbor remained a mystery. We exchanged momentary glances, but no words were ever spoken between us. Curiosity gnawed at my mind, wondering what secrets she might be hiding within the walls of her secluded home. Intrigued by her enigmatic presence, I found myself wondering what stories lay behind those closed doors. However, I couldn't bring myself to invade her privacy.\n\nIt wasn't until one sunny afternoon that a small note slipped through the crack beneath my door, interrupting the dull routine of my day. The note, written in delicate handwriting, was from the neighbor herself. It explained that she would be leaving town for a few days and requested my assistance in taking care of her beloved cat. ‘-Thanks, Shelly,’ it read.\n\nThe unexpected request filled me with a sense of excitement and anticipation. This could be the opportunity I had been waiting for to finally bridge the gap between us. With a newfound sense of purpose, I eagerly accepted the responsibility of taking care of her cat. With the note in hand, I cautiously approached her front door. The sound of my hesitant knock echoed through the stillness.\n\nThe door opened by itself, revealing a darkened interior. She must have left in a hurry, forgetting to lock the door behind her. I stepped inside, my eyes adjusting to the dim lighting. The house was eerily quiet, save for the faint sound of a clock ticking in the distance. The interior of her house was as mysterious as the woman herself. Dust particles danced in the rays of sunlight filtering through the half-closed curtains. The air was tinged with an odd scent, a combination of old books and lavender, creating a unique and comforting ambiance.\n\nInside, the cat, a beautiful black and white creature, regarded me with cautious eyes. I gently approached, offering a hand for it to sniff. After a moment of hesitation, it rubbed against my palm, accepting my presence. Even the cat seemed to possess the same air of secrecy as its owner. I realized that, perhaps, this feline companion had been the neighbor's only solace in a world she kept at arm's length.\n\nOver the following days, as I tended to the cat's needs, I found myself growing increasingly fascinated by its owner. I would steal glances at her empty house, wondering about the life she had chosen to hide away from. Despite her introverted nature, she had entrusted me with a responsibility, breaking through the barriers she had meticulously built around herself. Perhaps there was more to her than met the eye. With each visit, I left little notes of my own, recounting the daily adventures of her cat. It became a silent exchange, a secret bond forming between us.\n\n\n\n#fragments_by_sd #introvert #help #unknown\n\nWelcome to the day 7 of #YoStoWriMo or the YourQuote Story Writing Month i.e. May. \n\nCollab and write a #shortstory titled #theneighbourineverknew.
