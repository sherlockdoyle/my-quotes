Its charred walls told the story of a time long past. People whispered that it once belonged to someone wealthy, but no one knew for sure. What they did know - or at least believed - was that the brothers who lived there had fought over something and ended up killing each other. Their ghosts, it was said, still haunted the mansion, filling it with an eerie presence that kept people far away. No one dared visit the house, not even out of curiosity.\n\nIn the neighborhood, a group of troublesome boys used to gather behind Raju-da's tea shop. They would spend their time gambling, drinking, and causing trouble. But when the municipality shut down the tea shop, the boys were left without a place to meet. It was Nandu who first came up with an idea. He suggested they move their gathering to the old burned house. \"It's abandoned,\" he said. \"No one goes there. It'll be the perfect place for us to hang out.\" The group immediately liked the idea.\n\nA few boys hesitated, having heard the stories about the ghosts that haunted the mansion. They weren't keen on the idea. But when they voiced their concerns, they were met with laughter. \"Ghosts? In this day and age? Get real!\" the others mocked. Their protests were quickly dismissed.\n\nAs dusk fell, the boys gathered their few belongings: some drinks, a few drugs, and a deck of cards. Together, they made their way to the mansion. The air grew colder as they approached, but they paid little attention. They were too focused on the fun they anticipated. At the gate of the old house, they paused for a moment, staring at the dark, silent structure before them. No one was around. Of course, no one was supposed to be.\n\nThey sat on the porch, setting down their drinks and cards. Around them, the air felt thick, and the burned walls seemed to watch them. But the boys weren't concerned. They had heard the ghost stories, sure, but none of that mattered. They were bold, unafraid, and more interested in their fun than in old tales.\n\nThey began setting up, laughing and joking as they arranged the glasses. The dim light from a flickering candle barely cut through the darkness as they prepared to start drinking. The mood was light, and they were in high spirits. But just as they raised their glasses, a scream suddenly pierced the night.\n\nThe sound froze them. The laughter stopped, and the boys sat in stunned silence. The scream had come from somewhere nearby, or so it seemed. The joy and excitement drained from their faces, replaced by wide-eyed terror. No one spoke. Their mouths went dry, and their hands shook.\n\nBefore any of them could make sense of what had happened, they heard something else - a soft, rhythmic tinkling sound, like anklets, moving across the porch. The sound grew louder and clearer, as if someone, or something, was walking toward them. The boys clutched each other tightly.\n\nThen, breaking the silence, a burst of laughter echoed through the darkness. It was a harsh, unnatural sound. As they stared into the shadows, a nasal voice followed the laughter: \"Get out of here! Get out quickly!\" the voice repeated, rising in pitch.\n\nThat was enough. Terror overtook them, and without a second thought, the boys jumped to their feet. In their panic, they knocked over the glasses, spilled the drinks, and abandoned everything they had brought. Their legs barely kept up with their racing hearts as they ran, leaving the haunted mansion behind, never to return.\n\n---\n\nMitra and Mitro breathed a sigh of relief. Sumitra Rao and Abhinav Mitro had met in their first year of college. At first, they were just classmates, but by the time their third year rolled around, they had become inseparable. Their friends playfully merged their names, calling them Mitra and Mitro, and the nickname stuck. Over time, their bond grew deeper, and so did their desire to spend time alone, away from prying eyes.\n\nSince both lived in hostels, finding privacy had always been a challenge. That's when they discovered the mansion at the end of the alley. It was the perfect hideaway - deserted and feared by the neighborhood because of the ghost stories. No one ever came near it, except for them. Today too, they had come to their secret spot once again. But when they arrived, they were surprised to find a group of boys gathered there.\n\nMitra whispered urgently, \"Phew! We almost got caught. I told you not to come here. I had a feeling something like this would happen.\"\n\nMitro, smiling mischievously, kept his lips busy by kissing her on the neck. \"Don't worry. After what we did tonight, no one will dare come here again.\" He grinned proudly. \"That laugh and voice you did? It worked perfectly!\"\n\nMitra giggled. \"I really outdid myself, didn't I?\" she said, shaking her head in disbelief.\n\nWith the boys long gone, they turned on their mobile flashlights and walked inside the house, heading toward one of the familiar bedrooms they always used.\n\n---\n\nThe Sinhji family had once been the proud landowners of the area, their wealth and power stretching across generations. But over time, their influence faded. A century ago, the family's fortune had dwindled until only two brothers remained, each greedy for more than his share. Their relationship, once close, had soured, and their jealousy grew.\n\nOne fateful day, the younger brother devised a wicked plan to poison his sibling's family, intending to claim the entire estate for himself. But the elder brother had his own scheme - to burn his brother alive and escape with the wealth. However, neither plan went as intended. The elder brother, poisoned by his sibling's treachery, never managed to escape. Both brothers, along with their home, were consumed by the flames that day. The house was left in ruins, and their family line ended. What remained were the charred walls and the restless souls of the family, trapped within them.\n\nIn the bedroom, there was a large, old picture hanging on the wall - a portrait of the two brothers. In the painting, they appeared calm, but their souls, trapped within the image, whispered to one another. The younger brother spoke first, \"Should I kill these two rascals today? They're the worst.\"\n\nThe elder brother replied, \"Are you out of your mind? You saw how cunning those two are. If they die and become ghosts, they'll kick us out of here!\"\n\nThe younger brother huffed, clearly displeased. \"So, what then? Are we just supposed to tolerate them? Look at them! They're tearing into each other like hungry lions. I can't stand it.\"\n\nThe elder brother sighed. \"If you don't like it, close your eyes. You never listened to me when we were alive; at least listen to me now!\"\n\n\n\n#haunted #ghosts #mansion #mystery #terror #secrets #eerie #legend\n\nImage created with Dall-E.","f":"i","l":["hor","hmr"],"h":"https://www.yourquote.in/sherlock-doyle-9qp8/quotes/end-narrow-dark-alley-stood-broken-burned-building-charred-cuvsi5","p":"curv6n","n":"cuzxh8"}
